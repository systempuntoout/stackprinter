<ul>
<li><p><em>If it isn't already exists</em>, vote that one up so we see what the most popular answer is, rather than duplicating an existing entry.</p></li>
<li><p><em>If you see a duplicate</em>, vote it down so the top entries have only one of each model listed.</p></li>

              Building hardware for my Spectrum helped get me my first job. It let me ask difficult technical questions to the panel interviewing me, who must have been at least a little impressed.

              I can remember poking the built-in character set into sprites (more or less), so I could do some rudimentary game development. Gosh, I was about 14-15 y.o., and I had committed to memory so many addresses to peek and poke without having to use a reference. Prior to getting the Dataset storage device I used to write code and leave it on, hoping no one would mess with it and the power would not go off.

I had a Spectrum and later a C64 but their BASICs were too limited and I was never very good at translating large conditionals and subroutines to the GOTOs and GOSUBs that were available on those models. - <b> finnw</b>

<p>My Dad brought this home from his job at IBM when I was about 4 or 5 years old.  Specs of the 5150 that we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter" rel="nofollow">
CGA display
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup> (16 colors!)</li>
<li>Dual 5 1/4 floppy drives, A: and B:  (A: is the one on the left)</li>
<li>No hard drive!</li>
<li>64 KB of RAM</li>
<li>Keyboard: Function keys (F1-F10) on the left!  (See the image)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other machines of the time, the 5150 came with BASIC on the ROM image; the machine would boot to the BASIC development environment if there was no floppy in the A: drive.  You couldn't save your programs, though, unless you booted to a DOS diskette (DOS 2.0!) and ran BASIC from there.  </p>
<p>By the time I was 6, I was spending hours and hours programming on this thing!  F1=List, F2=Run, F3=Load, F4=Save...</p>
<p>Dad eventually added a 2400 baud modem to the machine -- I was in 3rd grade at the time, so around 1985 -- and I logged onto my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" rel="nofollow">

              As I started with a ZX81, the ZX80 was a kind of legendary lost ancestor thing. I never even saw a picture of one until about 1984, I think.

              Actually, the original ZX80 came with a 4K ROM - you could <i>upgrade</i> to the equivalent of a fast mode-only ZX81 by buying an 8K ROM.

I had the &quot;plus one&quot; extension that provided joystick and cartridge slot, although the only game I had was frogger, or the AcornSoft equivalent. I got very good at it. - <b> spender</b>

<p>A BBC Micro Model B when I was 7</p>

<p>I taught myself Basic on it and then taught myself 6502 assembler.</p>
<p>Some years later we got a word processor (Acornsoft View) ROM installed in it, a floppy drive (double sided, double density, twin floppy drive!), a proper monitor and a dot matrix printer.</p>
<p>It was all the computer I needed for about 10 years</p>

The local high school didn't get a computer until the following year.  The closest computer access for me was a dialup terminal at a public library 20 miles away.</p>
<p>So my first dozen programs were all written out by hand, and then executed on paper...</p>

Amstrad PC 1512

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>with two 5.25" floppy drives and a color monitor</p>
<p>It came with MS-DOS and the GEM window system. When I tried to make a backup copy of the GEM floppy, I actually destroyed it by confusing the SOURCE and DESTINATION parameters :-) That was my first WTF moment.</p>
<p>But I didn't find out about programming until I got my next computer, found QBasic and read the help file.</p>

              This was my first one too. I started programming with it - typing in assembler copied from a magazine, and the BASIC that was in GEM. - <b> harriyott</b>

              Two floppy drives? That was luxury, ours only had one, but did have a RAM upgrade to 640K 

My PC1512 was a Christmas present (around 86/7), my father left my mother to draw in the better GEM paint package a Happy Christmas message to me, but after he left the room the program kept giving Abort, Retry, Fail messages and despite her selecting Retry, somehow the paint application got deleted. 

I do seem to recall that GEM had some form of Basic, and certainly had a turtle as well - I played around with programming that although it was 10 years or so before I did any other programming. - <b> Sliff</b>

              Whoah!
I had that one, but with a monocrome monitor... my neighbour was the lucky one with a cga color one...

Also, my parent bought what here was called a &quot;hard disk card&quot;, that is, a hard disk hooked to a controller card, of a size of 40 Mbytes. Dad had to return that in exchange for a 20Mbytes, cos the 40 one, was to noisy to stay at home... hahahaha

But I loved the volume knob it had, for playing the games music at a high volume... Maniac Mansion, Mach 3, Double Dragon, IBM Golf, Space Invaders, IBM Alley Cat... Lotus 123 ;) - <b> Andor</b>

                <p>My first computer was the Timex Sinclair ZX81 as a birthday gift in 6th grade and I then purchased the 16 Kb memory module upgrade so that I could load the cassette tape based games that I had also bought with allowance.  I remember loading and saving programs to tape and eventually writing a Farm Market Simulator game and playing that with all of my friends in the neighborhood.  We'd all crowd around the old B/W television set and watch the random numbers generated for corn, soybeans, cows, and pigs and then we'd all pick how much we'd invest in the items each month.</p>
<p>It was my first introduction to programming and even though I couldn't get my hands wrapped around how the games I played worked, Flight Simulator and Maze, it started me down the technology path and shaped the patience I have for troubleshooting the issues I run into today.  Thanks Timex/Sinclair...</p>

<p>Oh wait.  You said "programming."  Well, TI gave me a programmable calculator I could take home.  That was 1979.  But I didn't use it much.  The first computer I took home had a "Turbo" button on it.  If you didn't push the button, it ran at 6Mhz, to let games run that depended on timing.  I wasn't too long after that when I got a laptop.  I think it was 20MHz, maybe 40Mhz 286.  It's probably in the garage collecting dust.</p>
<p>The first computer I programmed was an IBM 360 in 1971, but that was for a paying job, and the computer was a tad large to take home. :-)</p>

MikroMikko
</a><sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup></strong>!</p>
<p>These were manufactured in Finland by Nokia Data, a division of the company that later went on to concentrate on mobile phones and networks. (Nokia Data was sold in 1991 to ICL, which in turn was absorbed to Fujitsu, or what nowadays is Fujitsu Siemens Computers.)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.airtimemanager.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/mikromikko.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>I had the original model, MikroMikko 1 (pictured), which dated from early 1980s. It was equipped with:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 MHz Intel 8085</li>
<li>64KB of RAM</li>
<li>No hard drive but two 5.25" floppy drives (which had been labeled "program" and "data" by some previous owner)</li>
<li>Gorgeous green-on-black display</li>
<li>Some early version of DOS, I think, and a Basic interpreter</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't really say I <em>fell in love</em> with programming with it - I just toyed around
and created primitive Basic programs. (I did plan some elaborate text adventure game but never got around implementing it properly with my <em>very</em> limited Basic skills.)</p>

<p>The Datavue Spark, though mine was white(ish)!<br />
I've had countless nights with GW-Basic, Quick Basic, DOS debug and old Sierra games together with this beast...<br />
My screen died after about a year, after I fiddled with some wires back in the modem slot, and after that I had an external CGA montitor instead.<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Datavue Spark was one of the First Laptops Ever Made. It Featured a Powerful (Back Then) Intel 8088 with a clock Speed of 9.77MHz.</p>
<p>It had a tiny blue 5” screen made by Epson that supported 16 Colors. DOS could be run on this system, but needed a boot disk to do anything.</p>
<p>Due to a very high retail price, very few Spark were sold. Datavue made it up until 1993, then the company went under due to the many more powerful laptops on the market at the time. Datavue produced many other laptops.</p>

<p>Primarily a word processing machine - you could either boot into LocoScript, or if you used a different (3") floppy, into CP/M.  In CP/M you could use something called 'Mallard BASIC' (if memory serves - so named because it was as fast as an Olympic runner named Mallard!)</p>

<p>As you can see it used standard audio tapes for storing the software. Copying one was as easy as having a double tape deck (which wasn't that common at the time) and making a copy of the audio track. I think it was a bit of a problem for all the software vendors at the time :)</p>

                <p>The Amstrad PC1512 was the first computer I actually owned too. I didn't spring for the color monitor tho, had to put up with the weak black &amp; white monitor. I remember swapping out one of the floppy drives for a hard drive. Agonized for days over whether I could afford the 20MB drive or would have to settle for the 10MB. (This was 1986 or 1987.) I remember sitting in my Compilers class, daydreaming of all the stuff I'd install on the drive, and figuring that no way could it use up 10MB -- but I got the 20MB anyway. Maybe I was feeling wealthy for some reason; more likely I was hoping my wife didn't find out how much I'd spent.</p>

<p>Check out that keyboard.  There were plastic overlays for different games and the one for the BASIC interpreter gave you "color" keys -- basically three different shift/ctrl/alt keys that turned it into a "full" keyboard.  There was also a "gold" key that provided whole words "print," "goto," etc to make things faster.  Wow...what a drag.  :)</p>

                <p>Apple ][E of course. In fact that computer is older than me (Built in the seventies) but it got me started and I used it for years claiming it as my own when the family got a 386.</p>
<p>I started programming on it when I was seven because my Dad had been teaching my brother how to code on it and I was jealous for the attention. It ended up that my older brother now does nothing to do with coding and it has been my greatest hobby ever since.</p>

                <p>An unbranded 386 PC with both 5 1/4" and 3.5" floppy drives. It came with DOS but we soon upgraded to MS Windows 3.0 with a dozen or so floppies. 
Before that I had done programming on GW Basic on school computers, so DOS based QBasic loaded with this thing made me super-excited. It was a super-productive IDE for me :) No need to generate line numbers for each line :)</p>

                <p>TRS-80 Model 1. We got it when I was 8 years old, and somehow my parents got a set of programming books meant to teach kids BASIC. We also had a floppy disk (and LPT port) adapter that was about the size of a standard AT style case and sat under the monitor, while the TRS-80 Model 1 itself was built into its own keyboard. </p>

<p>That was the one that did it for me.  I had so much fun on it with its Basic and the Extended Basic add-on.  Of course you had to be careful with the cassette and loading and saving programs.  Tons of fun :)</p>

                <p>My first true compy was a Schneider Joyce. It had Mallard Basic and Wordstar on a floppy iirc, and the printer connected via a very proprietary plug to the main unit which housed both the CPU and the green monochrome monitor (I am talking 1980's here - Schneider the German company later sold out to or merged with Amstrad the British).</p>
<p>Before that, I owned a second-hand Sinclair ZX-81 with a memory extention thingy that added 16 Kb (as in a whopping 16384 bytes) to the on-board 4 Kb RAM (4096 bytes). The display was a small 6" black-and white TV I could lay my hands on (Russian Shiljalis, still have it. Runs on 12 Volt car battery, and also on a 220 Volt adapter. Manual includes detailed circuit diagram, for reasons unbeknownst to me).</p>
<p>And way before that, as a high-school student I used to spend some of my free time in the local Capi-Lux store, where they had an TI-41C on display. Or perhaps it was an 11C. It was the first programmable calculator I have ever interacted with. Stopping there after school, I would input the code from the manual (50 or so lines, with a calculator-style keyboard, nothing qwuerty-like in sight) to play "Moonlander". The objective of the game was to iteratively input fuel burn rates in such a way that at the end of your fuel, your elevation would be zero and your speed as well. </p>
<p>Heck, in 1973 I was the first in my class to own a digital watch! It had a LED display. Go figure.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I had my C64 modded to add a second SID (sound) chip for six-voice stereo music and a 512K memory cartridge (I think... it might have just been 256K) for use with GeOS.</p>

                <p>First one I used properly was a Commodore PET that my dad used to bring home from work to keep me amused in the school holidays. The first one I owned was Sinclair ZX81, and I upgraded the memory myself by relacing the 1k memory chip with a 2k one, and wielding a soldering iron to change a link so it picked up the difference.</p>
<p>From there on to a ZX Spectrum, but also programmed BBC Micros at school, along with a UK101:

<p>At uni I had an Amstrad PCW8256, using the cracking CP/M O/S, and Turbo Pascal (I think) for proper programming.

                <p>From about 1984, my parents had an IBM PC 5150, and I was so mad that it had no graphics of any sort. My friends all had Spectrums and Commodore 64s. We had a total of 2 games - Othello and "BUGS!" (a Centipede clone done entirely in ASCII characters which I still can't locate anywhere on the web to my increasing dismay). I broke Othello trying to reprogram it. Doh!</p>
<p>But actually, no graphics turned out to be an amazing thing as I ended up loving text adventures so much that I started writing them and programming very badly in BASIC. One thing led to another and now coding pays for my whole life. I still kind of miss the glowing green text-only interface though... but not the endless floppy disk failures. Ugh.</p>
<p>Oh, and I still hanker after the days I spent on my Amiga 500+ which is now going yellow in my attic. It still works somehow, just with a few more guru meditation errors.</p>

                <p>I had a TI-99 in college, but I never did anything useful with it.  My first home computer I had for real was a HP 150 in approximately 1984.  I was one of the very few people to have a computer in college.  It had a touchscreen monitor!! My mother worked for HP as a programmer, so she got a discount on it - it was only about $5K.  I used it all through college and for at least four years afterwards.</p>
<p>But what made me fall in love with programming was taking a programming class in high school in about 1980.

                <p>My first home computer used a TMS9900 chip (which was the first one-chip 16 bit microprocessor).
I designed it myself and made the circuit board myself.  And built it myself, of course.</p>
<p>I then wrote a monitor, translated it to machine code by hand and entered it using the toggle switches on the CPU board.  Once I had that I could use the terminal (which I had designed and built myself) to enter machine code more easily.</p>
<p>The storage was an old cassette player where I had ripped out all the electronics and attached straight the the read/write head with my own electronics.  But I rarely turned off the computer and had battery backup for the memory.</p>
<p>The first bigger pieces of software I wrote was an assembler and a text editor so I could code more easily.  After that I write an operating system (Unix-like, but without parallel processes) and a C compiler.</p>
<p>After a while I also got 5 1/4" floppy drives (what an improvement over tape) and built a graphics card.</p>

<p>In 1981, my older brother was a regional manager for Digital, and when I mentioned to him that I was interested in getting a personal computer - maybe the new Apple II-C - he said he had a computer at home in his closet he'd be happy to give to me.  Elated, I took him up on it and we proceeded to load it up.  We parted with him telling me "not to call him with questions".  Little did I know what that was going to mean...</p>
<p>When I got it home, I set it up in my den and tried to figure out how to turn it on.  There was no manual for it, and no On/Off switch.  There was one marked "0/1", but that meant nothing to me.  the only manuals I had were for the O/S, and they massed more than the hardware!</p>
<p>Eventually, I got it up and running and wrote my first Basic program on the box.</p>
<p>I later replaced it with a Digital Rainbow (sweet machine!).</p>

<p>Epson sold in the '80s a PC called the "QX-11". As far as I know, it was only sold in parts of Latin America and -- at least in Venezuela -- marketed under the name "Abacus" as a bundle with some very impressive (if crash-prone) productivity software with a Spanish UI, apparently custom written in-house.</p>
<p>An 8086-2 8Mhz processor, an impressive high-resolution monochrome display at 640x400 (fully graphic) with text sharp-as-knife; a sound chip with 3-channels (sound tones) + 1 ("noise") with 16 independent volume levels; two Atari-2600 joystick ports, a battery-backed RT clock and DOS 2.11 in ROM (fast, floppy-less boot) as well as support for some custom ROM cartridges (I never saw one, and don't know what they were for). The box was about 3" x 10" x 12". The floppies were 3 1/2", but used a 360KB format.</p>
<p>The Abacus software featured always-active WYSIWYG bold/italics/underline display, drop-down menus and mouse support; there was a bitmap drawing program that could be driven with a mouse or a joystick and a spreadsheet with charting that could save to the same file format as the drawing program. The Word processor had on-the-fly text justification, customizable tab-stops and margins that could change anywhere in the document and embeddable images... all this while my peers were using WordStar.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. It also came with GW-BASIC. I was doomed.</p>

                <p>I started when my dad sat me down in front of an HP desktop computer - single line of 7-segment leds for text, with a cassette interface and a big platter hard drive.  Later I played a little with a Sol-20 as mentioned above.  However, a couple of years later, what really caught me was the Epson QX-10 that my mom bought to do contract word-processing work.  </p>

<p>It was a beautiful machine witih a Z-80, 265K bytes of bank-switched RAM, bit-mapped graphics, running TP/M, an extended version of CP/M.  During the day she used VALDOCS, the highly-integrated WYSIWYG word-processing and business software, an at night I got to peek and poke at it with MS-BASIC and 8080 assembler.  Lots of learning that summer...</p>

                <p>PDP-1 was the first one I used, but they wouldn't let me take it home. The first home computer was a VIC20. I eventually added a 8K RAM expansion for a total of 11.5K and a single side floppy disk drive. </p>

<br />http://www.technology-props.co.uk/frames/images/toshiba_3100e.jpg</p>
<p>When I was 9, I was offered my first computer for Christmas, a 7Kg laptop by Toshiba. 
I was happy playing with GW/Q-Basic, Lemmings for Dos, typing some funny texts or filling spreadsheets using Works, stuff like that.
Since it had no battery, everytime I was visiting family I actually had to transport the <em>thing</em> itself <em>and</em> to bring the power cord along (which was exactly the same as the ones for workstations).</p>
<p>Here are the original specs:
<em>"Model from Toshiba with orange 640*400 plasma screen. CPU: 80286-8 (8/4.77MHz). 640 Kb RAM, 20 M hard drive and 720 K floppy. Operating system: Toshiba MS-DOS 2.11 shipped with earlier models, MS-DOS 3.2 shipped later. Weight 6.6 kilo, size 308x80x360 mm."</em></p>
<p>Since it wasn't even sporting a 386-type CPU, I could not install Windows 3.1 on it. It was high time I moved to a "multimedia" 486DX/66 PC (but that's another story...)</p>

                <p>Like a few folks here, the C64 was my first. At the time I didn't' think of getting into a career of programming (hell the area that I was from, they still don't' have reliable high speed internet), but had some programming books for the machine, and even made some programs in BASIC (remember GOTO loops? Good times.).</p>
<p>Also found that my one of my uncles was studying up FORTRAN and COBOL back when they were brand new, and used to read (well try too anyways) the manuals from his schooling days. Should have read a bit more, I'd be making more money if I knew that stuff.</p>

If I changed all the values to 0 the game became much easier. (But not as fun.)</p>

Intel 8008
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>, in the 70s. I made a little board with wire-wrap sockets containing the CPU chip, a PROM chip, an 8-bit parallel I/O chip, and a timer chip for the memory. Then I made a power supply out of a transformer, diodes, some voltage regulators, and a couple <em>big</em> capacitors, all kind of poured into an aluminum box. I programmed the PROM to play a little duet on a couple of speakers clipped to two I/O lines.</p>
<p>There was a small disk capacitor soldered on one end that, if you tucked it under another wire, would cause the timer chip to slow down by a factor of 1000. That caused the duet to play r-e-a-l-l-y slow, so you could hear the speakers just clicking.</p>
<p>Then when I was a professor teaching intro C.S. I would bring the whole thing to class in a paper bag, and use it to demonstrate how no matter how fast a computer seems, it is still basically doing one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Coincidentally just before reading this question I read a few questions about security.  You know, the biggest security problem is unwarranted assumptions.  Now even though this question isn't a security issue, it demonstrates the exact same problem: unwarranted assumptions.</p>
<p>My first home computer was not the one that made me "fall in love" with programming.  My first home computer was made by and lent by the employer that I was working for at the time, around 15 years after I "fell in love" with programming.</p>
<p>My first home computer had no compiler on it, for any language.  If I hadn't already been in love with programming I surely wouldn't have done so from this one.</p>
