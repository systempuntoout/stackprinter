<p>I'm trying to improve my working environment and I'm still searching for that perfect keyboard that practically types bug-free code all by itself. At the moment I'm using a Logitech Wave for my Windows need and an Apple Wireless Keyboard (the one without a numeric keypad) when doing OS X stuff. I'm quite happy with the Logitech Wave but I would prefer one without all the extra multimedia buttons. </p>
<p>What I like most about the Apple Wireless Keyboard is that it is very similar to the Macbook's keyboard which for me makes it easier to write code when on my Macbook. </p>
<p>What kind of keyboard would you recommend for going all out writing code until your fingers bleed? </p>
<p>I have remapped the Caps Lock key to Ctrl which after a while feels really good, until I have to sit at another computer or when someone at work is going to show me something on my computer. Are there other little keyboard tricks that you use to get a little bit more productive? I have looked into switching to Dvorak but I have decided it's not for me.</p>

                    What&#39;s the point of remapping Caps Lock? Is it to reduce the distance your fingers have to stretch when pressing Ctrl + &lt;some other key&gt; ? - <b> Don</b>

                    Right, it reduces the distance and the position of the Caps Lock key is more comfortable to use together with other keys for some persons. Also, it gives a useful function to a normally useless (or even harmful) key. - <b> Sebastian Rittau</b>

                    CAPSLOCK is evil and must be destroyed because it is not necessary (ie useless) and the only time it is pressed is by accident, which causes you lose time retyping whatever you just wrote.

                    Caps Lock haters either just use shift for uppercase identifiers or they have a decent editor with some kind of completion. That being said, caps lock should die (look at the  ChromeOS), I have mine remapped to another Ctrl, eases the pain a lot (and also makes it easier for Ctrl-Space completion in Eclipse). Caps lock was nice in the days of type writers, now it&#39;s just a nuisance. - <b> Egon</b>

I even use the front extension to relive the strain on my wrists.
At first it seems weird, but now, my wrists feel even stronger.

              I cannot put into words the depth of my loathing for the 4000. I bought it because I need an ergo but it has been nothing but suffering for me, from the gumdrop-sticky resistance of the keys that makes my hands ache after a single paragraph to the wobbly spacebar that won&#39;t register anything but a slam dead center and forces me to backspace and insert the space after the fact one time in five.

I need an ergo keybaord, but I need one that doesn&#39;t cause me transpose letters and develop RSI! Is there one like this with way less stickiness? - <b> Crashworks</b>

The spacebar gets stuck, the &#39;.&#39; key doesn&#39;t work unless you hit it real hard, and the place I got it from said that that;s how all the pieces are.

              After all these recommendations I went out and bought one. Build quality is very poor, buttons feel mediocre (except the special buttons which feel exceptionally cheap), and the layout is designed for somebody with HUGE hands. I have tried to get used to this for 2 months and I&#39;m giving up. Maybe if my hands were well above average size this would be a nice keyboard to type on.

Originally I had it (or similar style keys at least) on my MacBook but then I bought the desk version and it is great as well.

              These things are horrible. When I bought a MacBook I bought one to go with it. It almost put me off using the Mac completely. In the end I found and old 2003 vintage Mac keyboard on ebay. Seems I&#39;m not the only one that hates them as there was a lot of competitive bidding for those old keyboards.

              I&#39;ve got one and they&#39;re really impressive.
Yes, it&#39;s very noisy but you get accustomed to it.
It&#39;s all about the tactile response and feeling.
Das Keyboard requires less force to push the keys than a IBM Model M and these two much less than today keyboards which just feel like crap.
I purchased the Ultimate - no key tops version because 1. It&#39;s cool :) 2. I don&#39;t need it. 3. It doesn&#39;t exist for the layout I&#39;m using anyway! 4. I was willing to once learn all those keys I never know (special ponctuation like | * &#231; / # which need the meta keys on my kb layout). There is no wrist rest tough. - <b> user753136</b>

<p>I love the way the keys are stacked vertically instead of at an angle, and the way both thumbs are fully utilized.</p>
<p>The price tag is a bit scary, but it's well worth $300.  (I'd recommend getting the black case, though.  It's really easy to tell when the white case is getting dirty.)</p>

              Like a previous commentor, I fixed this problem by switching my mouse to my left hand. It took about a week to get back to normal speed, but after that, I never looked back.

Added bonus: if you&#39;ve got a coworker who uses your computer or &quot;explains things&quot; by pushing you out of the way to do it for you, a left-handed mouse (especially if you flip the left/right buttons, as I did) will stop that behavior in it&#39;s tracks. - <b> rwmnau</b>

              A major plus point for this model is that it doesn&#39;t have that ridiculous &quot;function key&quot; nonsense. I don&#39;t know what it is with manufacturers hijacking the damn things, but it drives me insane. Worse still, the bloody indicator light always seems to be wrong - the thing will invariably boot with the light off, and the function keys not behaving as function keys. Nice, solid Microsoft keyboard, excellent price, generally very pleasant typing experience. - <b> Rob</b>

              This is the keyboard I use and purchase for systems I build for others. I like it because it has a less dramatic split/curve than some other ergonomic keyboards; the function keys, arrow keys, home/end/insert/delete keys, and numeric keypad keys are all in the positions I am familiar with; but most of all the travel distance when keys are pushed is about half to 2/3 that of a &quot;regular&quot; keyboard, making it quick and painless to type on (fairly quiet too until it&#39;s over a year old). - <b> JYelton</b>

              I used to own this keyboard and i hated it - the button base is a rubber sheet and can get MISALIGNED - you will be banging the keyboard in frustration as keys go unresponsive. I had to continually unscrew the keyboard to try and get the rubber base realign so the keys would work.

              I bought one of these after reading this thread and although I like the tactile feel of the keys, the Ctrl instead of CapsLock is only slightly less annoying - I still accidently hold down Ctrl rather than shift and end up doing something weird. Ctrl should be in the bottom left and just have a bigger shift key. Moreover the Function+&lt;key&gt; combo is a real PITA! I use F1, F2 etc all the time and trying to work out Ctrl+Alt+Delete stops me in my tracks every time (esp. since I switched the Dlt to be Backspace).

              I bought one of these for gaming because of the extra keys (for Warcraft). But as a general keyboard, and particularly as a programmer&#39;s keyboard it is pretty awful. They keys are too spongy. The debounce is too agressive (hitting www very quickly often just results in 1 &#39;w&#39;). It gets into a state sometimes where certain keys stop working and it&#39;s not physically broken, just you just have to power-cycle it by unplugging it from the PC. Oh, and the casing, despite being over-engineered, is very flimsy and rattles a lot. - <b> U62</b>

<p>It takes time to learn to type on a DataHand, but for me it's been well worth it.  The $995 sticker price may be a bit of a shock.  But even if you only make $25 an hour, it pays for itself after one week if your body can't handle typing on a regular keyboard any more.</p>

              Olivier, just like the labels on the keys on a normal keyboard, the label on the DataHand is irrelevant.  Whether you get QWERTY or AZERTY depends on the keyboard layout you&#39;ve selected in your operating system.  DataHand Inc. doesn&#39;t sell the DataHand with AZERTY labels.  Nor do they sell it labeled with a Thai keyboard layout, but I can still type Thai on the DataHand perfectly well simply by selecting the Thai keyboard layout in Windows, just as I can type Thai on a Microsoft Natural Keyboard (which is sold in Thailand with a QWERTY layout and Thai stickers that you can paste on the keys). - <b> Jan Goyvaerts</b>

              Learning to type on the DataHand takes only a few minutes.  Your coffee break is plenty of time.  Typing at a reasonable speed on the DataHand takes a few weeks of practice.  Typing as fast or faster than on a regular keyboard takes a few months of practice.  But then again, learning to type fast or a regular keyboard takes practice too. - <b> Jan Goyvaerts</b>

              I can see why that would appeal to LISP programmers :)  Looking at the photo on wikipedia, it just looks like they mapped parenthesis where the square bracket keys are on a conventional layout. You could do that yourself with an IME editor if you think it would allow you to code faster. If you program in a C-style language you probably also type the curly braces more often than the square ones too. - <b> U62</b>

                <p>I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned it, but get an American layout keyboard.</p>
<p>This is because the functional character set of almost all programming languages were designed when using a US keyboard. Important keys like:</p>
<p><strong>" ; ' { }</strong></p>
<p>are on the home row or close to it. Having to stretch for shift-number combinations hampers productivity.</p>
<p>It may seem like an annoyance if you're used to a Swedish keyboard or whatever, but trust me, it's worth the (surprisingly) minimal time investment.</p>
<p>Of course if you're American, which is likely, this is less useful to you. Me, I'm a Brit and have been programming with US layout for 15 years or so now.</p>

              I just bought this keyboard after reading this post.  I LOVE it!  It is simple, I can type like a demon because the key response is fast like a laptop, and it is wireless.  It doesn&#39;t come with a lot of function keys, but in my opinion, that is good. - <b> j0rd4n</b>

                <p>Others have mentioned the kinesis advantage keyboards - I've given them a try and they are indeed very nice.</p>
<p>However, I instead opted for the cheaper kinesis freestyle:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/images/freestyle-vip_648x339.jpg" alt="Kinesis FreeStyle VIP" title="Cherry G80-11900" /></p>
<p>It's a very high quality keyboard, with a pretty standard layout, except for the obvious difference that it's split into two units.</p>
<p>With regular flat keyboards, I'd tend to have to bend my wrists quite a bit, causing a flare up of pre/early carpal-tunnel symptoms and pain.  Standard ergo keyboards like the MS 4000 help, but they don't quite have enough separation. The physical split of the freestyle lets me position the boards for most comfort - with neither of my wrists very bent.</p>

              I use this keyboard but keep it flat with a good 5-6&quot; separation. This helps my shoulders stay square so I don&#39;t hunch inwards (I originally switched to this because of a winging scapula). My only complaint is with the home/end/pg up/pg down layout: this doesn&#39;t match some &quot;semi-standard&quot; laptop layouts that I have seen and used for years where the order from top to bottom is home/pg up/pg down/end. - <b> wweicker</b>

              I have the 2020 and like it.  The biggest thing for me is the split sides (more pronounced than the 2030 shown here) which allows the keyboard to be smaller while still positioning the hands more widely than a normal keyboard.  The center keys are easy to get used to, but the grid layout is more difficult.  Still, the grid minimizes finger travel which could be important if you have significant RSI issues (I don&#39;t).  Switching back to the staggered keyboard on my laptop is a mental shift, not too bad but annoying even after having used it a while.  Of the two, I prefer the grid layout.

              I have actually tried this keyboard out. It really is a nightmare. One of the most annoying things about the keyboard is that the &quot;special keys&quot; like Ctrl, alt, arrow keys, and all other keys a programmer needs, are hidden between other keys. This may be a good keyboard for a text writer, NOT for a programmer. - <b> Jan Willem B</b>

<p>This keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever used. The feel of how the keys press is silky smooth.</p>
<p>Also: not having a NUM pad. Big improvement! The closer you can bring your mouse arm into your body, the better!</p>

                <p>I've been using the Logitech MX5000 for a couple of years now, and I <strong>love</strong> it.</p>
<p>I love the little LCD screen that displays emails as they come in, and saves me the trouble of switching to Outlook for unimportant emails. It also displays the time and date, and has a little built-in calculator. These things may seem small and trivial, but they all add up and save time.</p>
<p>Plus, it is very customizable. You can personalize a lot of the keys to do pretty much anything from launching apps to opening web pages, folders or files.</p>

              This keyboard is rubbish, in my opinion. Complete waste of money. It&#39;s bluetooth, and the USB dongle it ships with is crap (trouble with the drivers on every machine I&#39;ve ever tried it with) - it tries to be both a &quot;standard&quot; logitech RF receiver AND a bluetooth receiver. Pairing it with the bluetooth in a Mac is better, but still not good. It feels laggy, too, and drops random key presses. I&#39;ve switched completely to wired keyboards simply for the instant response I missed so much. The LCD is a novelty that wears off quickly. Don&#39;t buy this keyboard - it drove me insane. - <b> tomfanning</b>

              I find the problem with this one is you have to reach over way too far to get to the mouse. I haven&#39;t had wrist problems but rather back/shoulder problems so constantly rotating my body from left to right to get to home row then over to the mouse then back is tough for me. Then again the width of the keyboard + mouse on my desk is double the width of my body as I am quite skinny... it&#39;s disappointing for me that there aren&#39;t more options for various body sizes! - <b> wweicker</b>

                <p>I like the Microsoft Natural keyboards too -- splitting the keyboard down the middle may seem awkward at first, but once you get used to it, it just feels more... "natural".</p>
<p><b>But if your goal</b> is to "type bug-free code all by itself" then your IDE may have a much bigger impact on productivity.  Choose an IDE that has excellent <b>code completion and refactoring</b> tools.  If you're already locked into an IDE, then learn more of its features so you can squeeze more "juice" of it.</p>
<p>After all, why do the heavy lifting yourself when you have an IDE power tool?  You shouldn't have to write any more template methods or manually code refactoring tasks that can be determined programmatically.</p>
<p>(Personally, I'm using IntelliJ IDEA right now.  I really like its slick code completion and powerful refactoring capabilities.)</p>

              IntelliJ is really the best Java IDE on the market. There is no doubt about that.
If you do C, C++, Ruby, python, it&#39;s good enough, but these languages just don&#39;t allow the IDE to work the same as with Java.
Some C errors cannot be found before compilation and it&#39;s very difficult to have autocompletion with ruby and python because as they are interpreted you can almost &quot;do everything&quot; when Java limits you to classes, public methods, JavaDoc etc.

I&#39;ve got a Das Keyboard and IntelliJ.

No, for me this is the ONLY version of the Natural Keyboard that deserves to be remembered as a great keyboard. I even stocked up a few via ebay once the old version was replaced with the ugly new ones because there wasn't anything remotely comparable available or in sight.</p>

                <p>I've been using an IBM model M15 for years now, and bought a second one on eBay last year. They're not cheap, but have made a huge difference to my ability to get work done.  The halves are fully separable as you can see, so I can keep my shoulders relaxed (I have a shoulder injury that makes this difficult if my hands are too close together).</p>

<p>I've used both the first generation and the second generation (with the MX1000 laser mouse). I liked the low-profile buttons and the mobile numpad although the numbad really drains battery when used with the Logitech-drivers (which provides email notifications, current song, etc).</p>

<p>Personally, I like laptop style keyboards. I've always loved the look and feel (some more than others, of course). Logitech diNovo Edge was an excellent addition, however the lack of a number pad was annoying. I currently use the Logitech Illuminated Keyboard:
<img src="http://www.logitech.com/repository/1170/jpg/9726.1.0.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>It feels great, although a little bit more 'clicky' than I'm used to. It's super thin, but still has a similar layout to old keyboards. </p>
<p>So there are my 2 cents.</p>

              I use a Unicomp keyboard myself.  Very nice typing experience, and I&#39;d certainly recommend them (in fact I do on my website) but they don&#39;t have the same build quality as the old IBM Model Ms.  Just little things like the uniformity of the finish, &amp; a little moulding flash on the keycaps. - <b> Duncan Bayne</b>

              The Unicomps are, to put it shortly, absolutely awesome. My experience (unlike @Duncan Bayne) is that they&#39;re completely comparable to Model Ms in all respects, only better with command keys and USB (and black, if that&#39;s your thing). The only better keyboard I&#39;ve used so far is Das Keyboard S Professional, and it&#39;s quite a bit more costly. - <b> Tomer Gabel</b>

<p>Not only it is small, reducing the gesture to reach the mouse, when necessary, but it's design is also made to reduce finger's movement while typing. Aligning keys vertically is really a simple but brilliant idea, it ease reaching upper keys comparing to other keyboards.</p>
<p>And of course, the Dvorak layout is also a great improvment comparing to the old timer qwerty (or any other "designed for typewriter layout").</p>

                <p>A keyboard I saw many years ago at Comdex I think had the potential to be very good but they didn't do it right.  The keyboard was built into a chair, one half on the left arm and one half on the right arm.  It would be virtually impossible to use if you weren't a touch typist but it only took me a few seconds to get the weird setup out of my mind and simply type--touch typing reflexes work perfectly despite having the pieces widely separated.  Your arm rested on the chair arm and it held your hand at the right position to type.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the fools took this good idea and ruined it with a terrible keyboard.  I never saw anything of them after that.</p>

<p>Just take a look at the brackets dynamic, instead of having ; and : on the same key you get { and with shift [. </p>
<p>You get , and ; sharing the same key as . and : do. It suffices that you are fast enough with the shift key and you'll be coding faster than in your american layout performance.</p>

                <p>I've been using MS Natural keyboards for ages: Impressive.</p>
<p>The feel is very natural (no pun intented) to me and I've adopted it everywhere I worked (Usually by bringing my own keyboard instead of the Dell Generic Keyboard). There are some other keyboard that are equally interesting, but once you've found what you like most, why bother to change?</p>
<p>My advice is to get to your nearest computer store and try everything they have on display and choose one. Or you can believe me right away and order a MS Natural lol...</p>
<p>PS: I have no affiliation with Microsoft... Just happen to like that particular keyboard.</p>

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>. It has the individual spring action on each key, which is a big plus. I was getting severe pain in my finger bones after a few hours of coding with a normal membrane-type keyboard. Also, the keyboard is fully programmable, and comes with extra keycaps. (I keep mine in a "Unix" layout with the control key on the home row.) Finally, the keyboard is weighted with a solid metal bottom, which helps keep it in one place on a desk.</p>
<p><img src="http://regmedia.co.uk/2005/11/07/avant.jpg" /></p>
<p>The only downside with this keyboard is the amount of noise it generates, especially when touch typing. You might as well be using a typewriter. The keyboard is also larger than normal which can be an issue in tight quarters or when using with a keyboard drawer. </p>

<p><img src="http://www.keyovation.com/images/PRODUCT/icon/65.jpg" /></p>
<p>I used this keyboard as an intern and really loved it. I bought a brand new one, but the action sucked (the keys would never snap back and would trigger multiple times for single key presses) and they redesigned it by moving keys directly to the right of the backspace key (ouch). I sent it back and bought a used one on eBay. YMMV.</p>
<p>At home I use and love my MacBook Pro's laptop keyboard. I would probably get a wireless aluminum Mac keyboard for any Mac/desktop situation. On a related note, I think the thumb-positioned <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2007/08/11/how-apple-keyboards-lost-a-logo-and-windows-pcs-gained-one/" rel="nofollow">
Mac shortcut modifier key (command or "apple" key on the Mac)
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup> is much better ergonomically for common ZXCV commands than using Ctrl with the pinky on Windows/Linux. What do others think?</p>
<p>BTW I have an old (working) Model M exactly like DanV's above, from back in the day. Would I be remiss if I did not sell it on eBay to put it back into circulation? (instead of e-wasting it?) I used to love it but it is pretty loud and it wasn't the best for my wrists...</p>

                <p>I've used the Microsoft Natural-series keyboards, and those are quite good if you're big on the ergonomics. Duncan has a link to the current 4000 model.</p>
<p>Personally, I have a huge soft spot for buckling-spring keyboards like the original IBM Model M or (if you have an Apple background) the Apple Extended Keyboard I/II; there's a tremendous amount of tactile feel you miss out on with newer keyboards, and personally, I feel it really helps with my typing.</p>

<p>It might take some experimentation, but it's well worth it if you can get a keyboard that you can type on for hours without feeling any fatigue.</p>

                <p>If you don't want a keyboard that is completely split (I found it hard to go back and forth between split and normal keyboards) I would recommend the Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000.  It has a slightly more ergonomic layout without completely separating the keys.  My favorite part about this keyboard is that the keys are halfway between the height/travel of a laptop keyboard and a traditional computer keyboard making typing require less effort.  It is also a lot cheaper than the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard.</p>

                <p>I've been through approximately 15 keyboards in the last 6 years, at home, at university and at work.</p>
<p>So far, my favourites have been some properly old school keyboards that we had lying around at uni, which were made by a company called "Ergotronics", I believe (they were pretty much unbranded). These keyboards were quite heavily sloped toward you (I tend to use a high wrist rest, so my hand is pretty much flat), and the keys were very "clacky", giving great quality tactile feedback. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find these keyboards (or anything like them) for sale anywhere since I killed my last one.</p>
<p>I'm now onto a Dell SK-8115 (as featured on Coding Horror <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000327.html" rel="nofollow">
here
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>). So far, this keyboard has been with me a year, and is only really starting to show signs of wear now. It's got a great minimal footprint, having about a 2mm border outside the keys, and I love the oversized space bar. The only mod I made to it was to remove the caps lock -- the few times I need to write in all caps, I can cope with holding shift.</p>
<p>Personally, my ideal would be something along the lines of the Happy Hacker keyboards mentioned above, since I found (through much experimentation) that the major cause of RSI-related issues for me was having to reach an extra 4 inches across a numpad and cursor key group. To get around this (and to give my right wrist a break), I switched to mousing "goofy" a while back.</p>

<p>I use a Natural Keyboard Elite at work, but I prefer the Comfort Curve because it doesn't have an integrated wrist rest.  I prefer using a separate Imak wrist rest because they're much better than hard plastic.</p>

                <p>A lot of people get attached to particular keyboards, but once you've tried something different you realise that almost all the keyboards on the market are the same, and there's a few far superior but more expensive keyboards which actually change your typing experience.</p>
<p>Those I know of with a significant difference to the typing experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kinesis-ergo.com/" rel="nofollow">
Kinesis contoured keyboards
</a><sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup></li>
<li>DataHand family keyboards</li>
<li>Safetype ergonomic keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all significantly more expensive than normal keyboards, and are normally aimed at people who suffer from RSI. Make no mistake though, they reduce this suffering by improving postural problems and by <em>reducing finger movement</em>. The latter will help your typing speed.</p>
<p>Of these, I have only tried the Kinesis contoured keyboards, of which I now own two. They take a week or two to  get used to, and then you find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can type more accurately because the keys are arranged in vertical lines instead of in diagonals</li>
<li>Typing is more comfortable because your palms are supported</li>
<li>You type faster, because your fingers don't travel as far (keys arranged in a well around your fingers)</li>
<li>All the important modifier keys are on your thumbs, which are fast and strong. No more stretching awkwardly to do some command.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're serious about what's the best keyboard, I'm sure it will be one of the three keyboard types mentioned. They seem to be the only significant re-imaginings of what typing could be like. I highly recommend the Kinesis contoured ones. Hopefully someone will post reviews of the others.</p>

                <p>I use the Logitech S510 keyboard.  I love typing on it.  It's low profile and the keys are somewhere between a normal keyboard and a laptop keyboard as far as depth.  I have a newer keyboard, but recently fixed this one and no am back to using it!</p>
<p>Although now that I see I can buy a ThinkPad keyboard this thing may get replaced!  I love the keyboard on my ThinkPad and if the desktop version of the board is anywhere as nice as the one on my laptop, I'm sold.</p>

<p>I was choosing a keyboard just now (to replace a clunky standard Fujitsu Siemens one) and test-drived this against <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687/keyboard-for-programmers/53726#53726">
Logitech's UltraX
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> flat model, which admittedly looks way more elegant, but whose feel when typing was slightly "wrong" somehow, for me.</p>
<p>What I like about this basic Logitech keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feel is a good compromise - pressing the keys requires neither too much pressure nor too little.</li>
<li>Function keys and the "Insert/Delete/Home/End" block are laid out "normally" (and <em>not</em>, for example, so that the latter are grouped together with Prt Scr / Scroll Lock). To me this makes a surprisingly big difference in how natural it feels to use the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost of the Logitech 350 is a whopping <a href="http://www.verkkokauppa.com/popups/prodinfo.php?id=15968" rel="nofollow">

<p>Das Keyboard compares to the legendary IBM model M. Its best-in-class mechanical gold-plated key switches provide a tactile and audio click that makes typing pure joy. </p>

              I can&#39;t remember the exact sound/feel of the model M, but Das Keyboard does have a great feel to it, and if the clicking was much louder it would start getting annoying ;) - <b> jfs</b>

                <p>If you like natural keyboards, Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is definitely the way to go. I've got one at home and at work. The one thing i dislike about the keyboard is the lack of next/previous track. I workaround by by global keys in (winamp).</p>

                <p>I haven't found the best keyboard but I'm throwing a 'down vote' at the Logitech 'diNovo' bluetooth keyboard and media-pad. </p>
<p>The keyboard (not media pad) feels really nice with laptop-ish keys but the media-pad is a joke. If unused for approx 15 minutes it disconnects itself (I'm assuming to save batteries) but does not give any indication of it's 'disconnected' status so when you go to type some numbers with it there is a lag of a few seconds before they show up onscreen while it re-connects. As a result, the numbers will appear halfway through the next word you are typing. Very disconcerting to say the least. </p>
<p>Hope this save someone from 'number lag hell'. Cheers, David H Aust</p>

                <p>Another vote for the Apple Aluminum Keyboard. It's quiet and good-looking and I like that kind of keys (moving with very little resistance and just some millimeters). However, it's not everybody's taste - two people in our company ditched them, one for an Apple Wireless w/ numpad (the older model, looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Apple_Pro_Keyboard_%28open_top%29.jpg" rel="nofollow">

<p>I used a Logitech Wave before, which was quite nice in the beginning, but after just 9 months some keys are moving like they are half stuck (arrows were the worst).</p>
<p>In regard to layouts, if you have ever had to code with some non-US layout (like german, swedish, or in my case, estonian, where you have to press alt/option for []{} ) you will find that the US layout is actually quite nice. ;)</p>

                <p>nothing special?? The g15 is amazing or at least to me it is. </p>
<p>I got it when i graduated high school mainly for gaming but then when I got to college and started programming late at night for class/homework the LED keys helped immensely since I don't have perfect typing skills (I always place my hands in the wrong spot and end up a key to far right or left).</p>
<p>The LCD display is very helpful to and a fun thing to mess around with when you have nothing else to do. Although I still haven't found time to play around with writing any plug-ins for it.</p>

                <p>I also have the Kinesis Countoured Advantage.  I've only had it for 3 days though, so my reactions could be premature.</p>
<p>My number one complaint for programming is the placement of the [{]} keys.  They are really far down from your pinkie and ring finger, a little to far for my taste.</p>
<p>The biggest pro (other than amazing ergonomics) is the on board memory.  I use dvorak with a couple customizations.  In linux with other keyboards I have to set my X keyboard, use xmodmap for the customizations, and then set up extra keyboards to rotate between in case a co-worker or someone else needs to type on my computer.  With the kinesis, it switches itself to dvorak, and my special customizations are all programmed into the keyboard itself.  This makes it easier to reboot into windows and have all my customizations, etc.</p>

                <p>I have tried more than 10 different keyboards. But if I were to give the best, it would be to Dinovo Edge. The only bad thing about it is the crappy Logitech Setpoint software</p>

                <p>I've liked the Logitech diNovo keyboards since I got my first.  I find its much easier to type on them with the flatter keys.
I've also come to like the small size of the eeePc keyboards.  My hands are small enough that they fit quite well on them and I find them easier to type on then regular keyboards now.</p>

              Logitech diNovo keyboard is amazing BUT its blue tooth number pad is <i>terrible</i>.  The number pad will disconnect itself (to save batteries I assume) if unused for approx 5 minutes.  Then when you go to type numbers, there is a 2 second lag before the numbers show up on screen while it re-connects. - <b> David HAust</b>

<p>The keyboard doubles as a trackpad/mouse, so you don't have the strain of reaching
for a mouse, and you can use gestures for tab/right click etc. See the flash tutorials at:</p>

<p>Sadly, they went out of business a few years back; their multitouch technology was bought by a company called pear or kumquat or something, who wanted to incorporate it into a phone they were making. Wonder what happened to that project ? :)</p>
<p>I bought one of these keyboards 5 years ago after a bad attack of RSI threatened to end my career.. Offers to buy it are usually met with sentences involving the phrase 'cold dead hands'.</p>

<p>I'm a little sceptical about custom keyboards. If I get too accustomed to a keyboard with a different layout, I'll have trouble coding properly with a normal keyboard. All that muscle memory learnt is going to cause me to hit the wrong key, probably slowing things down.</p>
<p>I'll probably not go for a custom layout keyboard because of this reason. Unless of course, I take the custom keyboard with me wherever I go. Now that'll burnish my nerd image!</p>

                <p>second @mike's comfort curve keyboard. I use them both at work and at home.</p>
<ul>
<li>low-profile</li>
<li>good typing responsiveness feels very natural and unobtrusive</li>
<li>curve design to lessen RSI</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the fastest and the least-RSI keyboard I would type with. The low-profile is a big factor, <strong>don't underestimate low-profile keyboards and they did an awesome job with the spring underneath them</strong>, positioning your hand and body right, you could type uber-fast on it. plus it has a curvy anti-RSI style design too.</p>
<p>The wireless version of the MS Desktop 3000 's keyboard seems to be better than the wired version though, from my experience using both.</p>
<p>But I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good keyboard without any doubt!</p>

                <p>Using the wireless Apple keyboard here as well and i like it a lot. Mostly because of it's small footprint which allows me to point my shoulders inwards instead of outwards, creating a better ergonomy.
I tried out a typematrix keyboard a while back. I did love the feel and footprint, but the change in key positioning made me all confused. At the time i didn't have time to spend learning a new keyboard layout, so i put on to the side, and i still haven't gone back to it.</p>

                <p>The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is my current keyboard at home and I really do enjoy it.  I had a Logitech diNovo for about a year before the mouse died and couldn't be recharged so I got a new system where this one has so far been pretty good.  I like being able to move the keyboard around without worrying about a cable at home which is nice.  At work I have a Dell keyboard and mouse which seems to be typical at the moment.  Where I used to work they had a lot of Kensington keyboards that worked pretty good.  I do prefer a Microsoft Natural keyboard if I can get one.</p>

<li>Variety - I learned to use the mouse with my left hand. I have one on each side of my desk. Also have a trackball.</li>
<li>Take frequent breaks - stretch your limbs, flex your fingers, relax your eyes, take 5 mins every hour. It's not just good for your fingers.

<p>Where did you get that ? I didn't even know that it existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Wireless Keyboard with Numeric Keypads existed in their previous incarnations. The new "flat" Apple Keyboards are available in two flavors: </p>
<p>1) Full Keyboard with num keyboard + 2 usb2.0 ports (one on each side).</p>
<p>2) Bluetooth Keyboards: No Numeric Keypad, no extra USB ports. The layout is like the MacBooks. (You have to use a FN key to use Fx functions under OS X, else you get some OSX fancy things, like Expose, Dashboard, etc). </p>
<p>I have a BT Apple Key (white) and I don't like the feel. I threw it after I started playing with the new flat ones. Not the best keyboard, but definitely better than the old model. </p>
<p>The problem with the Apple Keyboard (white versions) is that some keyboards block, and since it is transparent, dirt can be easily seen and it is sometimes impossible to remove. </p>

                <p>An unfortunate thing about these keyboards pictured here is that none of them has a "proper" big "L" enter key. Some of them have the big enter keys but they are upside down and make the square bracket keys be on two lines rather than next to each other.</p>
<p>The big L enter key is a necessity, as it's a nice big target that you can easily hit. As I've got a more "standard" keyboard at work and many times I hit both the enter key and the slash/bar key at the same time.</p>
<p>I wish they made more of those big L enter keyboards again.</p>

                <p>My three favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>ORIGINAL Microsoft Natural Keyboard</li>
<li>MacBook Pro Keyboard</li>
<li>Das Keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm most efficient with the Natural Keyboard. However, I had to use my ThinkPad's keyboard for the first time in a few months and I'm really surprised how much faster I am on the MacBook's keyboard now. I think once you get used to the chording motions with Fn, you can move real fast with it. Also, I love the backlit keys - gorgeous. Das Keyboard for the cool factor - but it's very noisy.</p>

                <p>I also like the logitech G15. This is for several reasons:</p>
<p>1) it's a wired keyboard. Wireless keyboards can drop keypresses if your CPU gets heavily loaded (like during a big compile). </p>
<p>2) The built-in macro system is great- it's keyboard based instead of software based, so it pretty much works everywhere (i have one for the windows box and one for the linux box)</p>
<p>3) The key action is pretty good. It isn't an old-school clickety clack, but it has pretty good travel and feels crisp, not mushy.</p>
<p>Generally, I've found that gaming keyboards are a pretty good way to go in terms of coding keyboards- very functional and usually quite customizable. The same goes with mice- I find that gaming mice with their fifty different buttons is a great way to go for me.</p>

                <p>Currently, I use a Microsoft Natural 4000 at work. Beyond all the typical reasons to use this keyboard -- ergonomics, key layout, etc -- I've found that it has an added benefit: So few people use curved and split keyboards that no one wants to touch my computer while I'm away from it. Since I have a cubicle, sometimes it's hard to keep people from touching my computer when I'm away. At times, my computer has been reset because I left it locked. This is one way that I can protect against that without annoying the system administrator.</p>
<p>That Avant Stellar looks like my favorite keyboard ever: the Northgate Omnikey 102. That thing had a great layout. It was rock solid. The keys had just the right amount of resistance. You could easily remap it, in fact the keys were easy enough to take off an put back on that thorough cleaning was easy.</p>

                <p>One of the most significant changes you can make is to flip over to the Dvorak layout:</p>
<p><img src="http://dvzine.org/img/KEYMAP.gif" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>It takes some getting used to, but it is faster and puts much less stress on your hands because the common letters are on the home row.  For programmers, some of the "odd" keys get used more than if you are just typing ordinary prose and you lose some of the advantages there.  It might be worth trying one of the programmer optimized layouts for that.</p>

                <p>I use the Logitech G15 and absolutely LOVE it. But I'd have to say that the important thing is not so much which keyboard but picking one and sticking with it everywhere. There is a certain amount of mental overhead when the keys on one PC are different from another PC.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of the older style Ins Home PgUp / Del End PgDn horizontal setup than the newer vertical layout with the double-tall delete key. Switching between the two has disastrous effects on my productivity.</p>
<p>The worst situation would be having two different keyboards, one with the double-wide Enter key and the other with the obtuse elbow Enter key which occupies the same real-estate as the / key on double-wide version.</p>
<p>The G15 has two different versions. There is the older model with 18 "G" keys and a newer one with just 6. Personally, it doesn't matter. I don't even use them. But they are there if you want to hotkey macros and such.</p>

                <p>I have been using the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for ~2 years and using Microsoft natural keyboards for as long as they have been around.  IMO they are the best overall keyboard I have ever used.  I can type for hours on it without feeling discomfort and that's what really matters isn't it?  </p>
<p>The only downside of this keyboard is the mechanics of the keys.  It is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, just it could be better.  Closer to higher end keyboards such as the DAS or diNovo Edge</p>

                <p>I tried the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for a few weeks with the bracket that tilts the keyboard away from you.  The keyboard angle seemed quite good but I didn't like the "ergonomic" split design.  I'm a heavy keyboard user and I use hot keys when ever possible, in fact I even use them when it is not possible by implementing them in <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" rel="nofollow">

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>, and I found the split keyboard made some shortcuts nearly impossible to type.</p>
<p>So I stick with the Dell Enhanced USB Multimedia keyboard as pictured in &amp;nbsp's answer, though I never use the "media" buttons.</p>

It doesn't come with whizzbang features and an excessive amount of extra multimedia buttons, it's a great keyboard for development.

<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup> (sorry for the shameless plug). Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushed aluminium keyboard -- quality build.</li>
<li>Quiet keys - doesn't keep the family awake while I'm hacking away during the night.</li>
<li>Standard layout (underestimated feature imho :)).</li>
<li>Built-in USB 2.0 hub and sound ports for headset.</li>
<li>Very nice feel, keys are very comforable.</li>
<li>Tactile response.</li>
<li>Corded -- wireless keyboards are pointless for dev (imho).</li>

                <p>My vote is for the MS Natural Keyboard 4000. If you spend a large part of your day typing and you want to avoid the repetitive stress injuries that go with it an ergonomic keyboard is a must. </p>
<p>My one complaint on this keyboard is the placement of the function lock key where one would usually reach for F12. As part of my job I still do some RPG and other work on the AS/400(iSeries) and when you log in via the 5250 emulator the function keys are a critical part of getting around. I often find myself wondering why nothing works only to notice that I must have hit the function lock.</p>
<p>Other than that I have no real gripes. In fact I have one at home as well.</p>

                <p>I've got a DAS Keyboard and an old IBM (not the really old M, slightly newer but still very tactile)  The DAS is much louder than the IBM and the keys aren't quite as heavy on the DAS.  That being said, I much prefer typing on DAS, it seems to me that I can get going faster than I can actually type on the DAS, so I guess I need to increase my skill.  </p>
<p>That being said I use a crappy Gateway keyboard at work and it treats me ok.  One of these days I'll get around to replacing it, but for the time being it gets the job done with out  putting me in pain.  I steering away from the DAS because it's so noisy I think it might offend my co-workers.</p>
<p>I did have an MX5000 but I found the keys too mushy and every once in a while it would lag behind what I was typing by almost a full second.  I think it had something to do with the Bluetooth stack but still, unacceptable.</p>

                <p>Since I touch type, I find that the most important feature for me is that all of my keyboards are the same. I normally program on 5 different computers (not necessarily on the same network) and I find that I have the most problems when the keyboards don't match. Key positioning is critical.

                <p>I use a standard cherry USB keyboard without inscription (like 'Das Keyboard' but only costs 29€ not 100+€). You can drop a mail to cherry and they will produce one for you...</p>

                <p>I would like to second the customizer from <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html" rel="nofollow">http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html</a> Its 4 and a half pounds, of key clicking, nuclear brain damaging power. The one I got serveral years ago has a coiled chord and is made in the USA. And when you die, they can buy you with it.

                <p>The Logitech MK700 moves into the line of the MX5000 and MX3200.  I'm not sure if it's an upgrade, it has fewer media buttons, a standard home key block, and boasts 3 year battery life.  Gone is the MX3200 annoying optical, power munching slider on the left side (could be triggered with paper against the keyboard).  I fostered gentle hatred for the dedicated sleep button situated right where your hand brushes the keyboard as you're reaching for your mouse. Not even a "click-clack" warning and the screen is fading away!  Serious users have little regard for unexpected shutdown/sleep episodes.  The MK700 types pretty well if one is pushing straight down on the keys.  Off-angle key press force causes irregular pressure requirement, and more stress.  I'm comparing it with my DiNovo (flat blue) that has literally worn out (flat membrane, modernized home block).   I just ordered a Daskeyboard S Ultimate, then I realized that the same thing was available from less expensive sources.  Clickity clack, my keys are all black! When I grow up, I want a Topre Realforce 103.  I run Windows 7 Bootcamped on a MACBOOK Pro.</p>

                <p>How about <a href="http://www.diatec.co.jp/products/det.php?prod_c=569" rel="nofollow">
Majestouch Tenkeyless Non-Click(Cherry MX switch)
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> model?</p>
<p>It has not useless numpad and compact. Cherry keyboard uses too large frame. So I like Majestouch series. :-)</p>

                <p>surprised no body mentioned the asymmetry in the standard keyboards.
the homerow and the bottom row are offeset horizontally by  about half key size. so they are symmetrical for left and right hands.
but the home row and toprow are offset horizontally by about a quarter key size.  so they become asymmetrical for the left and right hand positons when fingers extend to the top row.</p>
