          <p>There are a lot of great programming quotes out there. Which do you like?</p>
<p>Today (Sept 12, 2008) I heard a new one from a friend, Lars-Gunnar, he said "<a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gud" rel="nofollow">
Gud
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> finns i Emacs" (in Swedish). This basically means "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" rel="nofollow">
God
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup> is in Emacs". Still laughing about it here :) What he meant was that a function "<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/GrandUnifiedDebugger" rel="nofollow">
gud is grand-unified-debugger
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[3]</sup>" is in Emacs.</p>
<p>A great one I think all programmers should know is <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris" rel="nofollow">

                    Closing doesn&#39;t prevent voting, it prevents adding more answers.  If you think that the people adding new &#39;great quotes&#39; are reading every single one of the 500+ answers beforehand to avoid duplicates, you are sadly mistaken.  If the site were designed to efficiently vote for polls like this (ie, a programming quote &quot;kitten war&quot;) then having thousands of quotes with duplicates would be ok.  Not so good for this site though.  Alternately, if there were an easy way to avoid duplicates then it could work ok.  As is, though, I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a compelling reason to keep it open. - <b> Adam Davis</b>

              I don&#39;t know exactly what Kernighan meant, but taken at face value I don&#39;t agree with this. Writing code cleverly is also about making it easy to debug.

              I love regex too, but people often use regex when they need a different kind of solution, like a parser.  If they use regex, they will constantly be fighting edge cases until the end of time.  Regex is a tool.  But if a hammer is the only tool you&#39;ve got, everything starts to look like a nail. - <b> Justin Standard</b>

              &quot;Free software&quot; is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free speech,&quot; not as in &quot;free beer.&quot;

              Free in the context of free software means that you are &quot;free&quot; to some extent to do what you want with it since you have access to the source code and can modify it to your needs. It has nothing to do with value. - <b> David Holm</b>

              The quote is perfectly accurate, in a non-ironic way.  If a &quot;free&quot; piece of software that duplicates all the features of one that costs $500, but it takes you 10 hours to get working the way the non-free version does, then the only way that&#39;s a net positive is if your time is worth &lt;$50/hour. - <b> bigmattyh</b>

              The quote as originally stated by the author was specifically referencing visual design: &quot;A designer knows he has achieved perfection...&quot; but it&#39;s equally as apt for development. I love and frequently use this quote, as it is one of the few times I&#39;ve found that visual design and software development actually have a common goal. - <b> markh</b>

              Stars don&#39;t &quot;happen&quot; in the telescope. Computations do infact happen in the computer. How is &quot;computer communication&quot; or &quot;software/hardware interface&quot; not about computers? This quote only applies to algorithms.

              Here&#39;s another: &quot;The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.&quot; -- Richard Hamming

The point that these giants of computer science were making, I think, is that computers are merely a means to an end and that there are universal laws of information and computing that hold whether or not there exist computing devices to execute them.

The computer is a tool that we may use to perform experiments, not something that has value in studying itself. - <b> sock</b>

              hasen j, the point of the quote is that in software development you usually need 1 &quot;baby&quot;, not 10, but you need it in a month.

              I would use &quot;++sheep&quot;, rather than &quot;sheep++&quot;.
It will do less copying, which is important because a sheep is a pretty complex object.

Also, it will help the rhyme scheme a bit (&quot;sheep increment&quot; does not rhyme with &quot;not asleep&quot;, but &quot;increment sheep&quot; does). - <b> Scott Wisniewski</b>

              @hasen j: The point of the quote is not that the proof (by Knuth!) is incorrect, but that any proof must start with certain axioms about the computational model, and the real world is always more complex. You may prove that a certain iteration always converges to the result, only to find that because of rounding-off issues it actually diverges in some case. Or, it was <i>proved</i> that breaking the RSA cryptosystem was as hard as factoring, until some clever computer scientists found &quot;side channel attacks&quot; by measuring timing, power consumption, sounds made by the processor etc.! - <b> ShreevatsaR</b>

                <p>The 3 virtues of a programmer as defined by Larry Wall, Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Christiansen (in Programming Perl). </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Laziness</strong> - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See also impatience and hubris.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impatience</strong> - The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and hubris.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hubris</strong> - Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience.</p></li>

<p>Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything. One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them. Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.</p>

<p>Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say "hey, that almost works for me", and they'll get involved in the project.</p>

    You tell your program you want to be shot in the foot. The program figures out how to do it, but the syntax doesn't allow it to explain. </p>
<p><strong>370 JCL</strong>
    You send your foot down to MIS with a 4000-page document explaining how you want it to be shot. Three years later, your foot comes back deep-fried. </p>
<p><strong>FORTRAN-77</strong>
    You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out of toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat. If you run out of bullets, you continue anyway because you still can't do exception-processing.</p>
<p><strong>Modula-2 (alternative)</strong>
    You perform a shooting on what might be currently a foot with what might be currently a bullet shot by what might currently be a gun. </p>
<p><strong>BASIC (compiled)</strong>
    You shoot yourself in the foot with a BB using a SCUD missile launcher. </p>
<p><strong>Visual Basic</strong>
    You'll really only appear to have shot yourself in the foot, but you'll have so much fun doing it that you won't care. </p>
<p><strong>Forth (alternative)</strong>

<p><strong>Pascal (alternative)</strong>
    Same as Modula-2 except that the bullet is not the right type for the gun and your hand is blown off. </p>
<p><strong>Snobol (alternative)</strong>
    You grab your foot with your hand, then rewrite your hand to be a bullet. The act of shooting the original foot then changes your hand/bullet into yet another foot (a left foot). </p>
<p><strong>Prolog (alternative)</strong>
    You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot, but the bullet, failing to find its mark, backtracks to the gun, which then explodes in your face.
    or
    No.</p>
<p><strong>COMAL</strong>
    You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol, but the bore is clogged, and the pressure build-up blows apart both the pistol and your hand.

    You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket. The musket is aesthetically fascinating and the wound baffles the adolescent medic in the emergency room. </p>
<p><strong>Ada</strong>
    If you are dumb enough to actually use this language, the United States Department of Defense will kidnap you, stand you up in front of a firing squad and tell the soldiers, "Shoot at the feet."<br />
    or<br />
    The Department of Defense shoots you in the foot after offering you a blindfold and a last cigarette.<br />
    or<br />
    After correctly packaging your foot, you attempt to concurrently load the gun, pull the trigger, scream and shoot yourself in the foot. When you try, however, you discover that your foot is of the wrong type.<br />
    or<br />
    After correctly packing your foot, you attempt to concurrently load the gun, pull the trigger, scream, and confidently aim at your foot knowing it is safe. However the cordite in the round does an Unchecked Conversion, fires and shoots you in the foot anyway.  </p>
<p><strong>Eiffel</strong>
    You create a GUN object, two FOOT objects and a BULLET object. The GUN passes both the FOOT objects a reference to the BULLET. The FOOT objects increment their hole counts and forget about the BULLET. A little demon then drives a garbage truck over your feet and grabs the bullet (both of it) on the way.  </p>
<p><strong>Smalltalk</strong>
    You spend so much time playing with the graphics and windowing system that your boss shoots you in the foot, takes away your workstation and makes you develop in COBOL on a character terminal.<br />
    or<br />
    You send the message shoot to gun, with selectors bullet and myFoot. A window pops up saying Gunpowder doesNotUnderstand: spark. After several fruitless hours spent browsing the methods for Trigger, FiringPin and IdealGas, you take the easy way out and create ShotFoot, a subclass of Foot with an additional instance variable bulletHole.  </p>
<p><strong>Object Oriented Pascal</strong>
    You perform a shooting on what might currently be a foot with what might currently be a bullet fired from what might currently be a gun.  </p>
<p><strong>PL/I</strong>
    You consume all available system resources, including all the offline bullets. The Data Processing &amp; Payroll Department doubles its size, triples its budget, acquires four new mainframes and drops the original one on your foot.   </p>
<p><strong>Postscript</strong>
    foot bullets 6 locate loadgun aim gun shoot showpage<br />
    or<br />
    It takes the bullet ten minutes to travel from the gun to your foot, by which time you're long since gone out to lunch. The text comes out great, though.  </p>
<p><strong>PERL</strong>
    You stab yourself in the foot repeatedly with an incredibly large and very heavy Swiss Army knife.<br />
    or<br />
    You pick up the gun and begin to load it. The gun and your foot begin to grow to huge proportions and the world around you slows down, until the gun fires. It makes a tiny hole, which you don't feel.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly Language</strong>
    You crash the OS and overwrite the root disk. The system administrator arrives and shoots you in the foot. After a moment of contemplation, the administrator shoots himself in the foot and then hops around the room rabidly shooting at everyone in sight.
    or
    You try to shoot yourself in the foot only to discover you must first reinvent the gun, the bullet, and your foot.or
    The bullet travels to your foot instantly, but it took you three weeks to load the round and aim the gun.</p>
<p><strong>BCPL</strong>
    You shoot yourself somewhere in the leg -- you can't get any finer resolution than that.</p>
<p><strong>Concurrent Euclid</strong>
    You shoot yourself in somebody else's foot.</p>
<p><strong>Motif</strong>
    You spend days writing a UIL description of your foot, the trajectory, the bullet and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles of the gun. When you finally get around to pulling the trigger, the gun jams. </p>
<p><strong>Powerbuilder</strong>
    While attempting to load the gun you discover that the LoadGun system function is buggy; as a work around you tape the bullet to the outside of the gun and unsuccessfully attempt to fire it with a nail. In frustration you club your foot with the butt of the gun and explain to your client that this approximates the functionality of shooting yourself in the foot and that the next version of Powerbuilder will fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Standard ML</strong>
    By the time you get your code to typecheck, you're using a shoot to foot yourself in the gun.</p>
<p><strong>MUMPS</strong>
    You shoot 583149 AK-47 teflon-tipped, hollow-point, armour-piercing bullets into even-numbered toes on odd-numbered feet of everyone in the building -- with one line of code. Three weeks later you shoot yourself in the head rather than try to modify that line.</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong>
    You locate the Gun class, but discover that the Bullet class is abstract, so you extend it and write the missing part of the implementation. Then you implement the ShootAble interface for your foot, and recompile the Foot class. The interface lets the bullet call the doDamage method on the Foot, so the Foot can damage itself in the most effective way. Now you run the program, and call the doShoot method on the instance of the Gun class. First the Gun creates an instance of Bullet, which calls the doFire method on the Gun. The Gun calls the hit(Bullet) method on the Foot, and the instance of Bullet is passed to the Foot. But this causes an IllegalHitByBullet exception to be thrown, and you die.</p>

    You create 10,000 strings describing the best way to shoot yourself in the foot. By the time the program produces the optimal solution, humans have evolved wings and the problem is moot.</p>
<p><strong>CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)</strong>
    You only fail to shoot everything that isn't your foot.</p>
<p><strong>MS-SQL Server</strong>
    MS-SQL Server’s gun comes pre-loaded with an unlimited supply of Teflon coated bullets, and it only has two discernible features: the muzzle and the trigger. If that wasn't enough, MS-SQL Server also puts the gun in your hand, applies local anesthetic to the skin of your forefinger and stitches it to the gun's trigger. Meanwhile, another process has set up a spinal block to numb your lower body. It will then proceeded to surgically remove your foot, cryogenically freeze it for preservation, and attach it to the muzzle of the gun so that no matter where you aim, you will shoot your foot. In order to avoid shooting yourself in the foot, you need to unstitch your trigger finger, remove your foot from the muzzle of the gun, and have it surgically reattached. Then you probably want to get some crutches and go out to buy a book on SQL Server Performance Tuning.</p>
<p><strong>Sybase</strong>
    Sybase's gun requires assembly, and you need to go out and purchase your own clip and bullets to load the gun. Assembly is complicated by the fact that Sybase has hidden the gun behind a big stack of reference manuals, but it hasn't told you where that stack is. While you were off finding the gun, assembling it, buying bullets, etc., Sybase was also busy surgically removing your foot and cryogenically freezing it for preservation. Instead of attaching it to the muzzle of the gun, though, it packed your foot on dry ice and sent it UPS-Ground to an unnamed hookah bar somewhere in the middle east. In order to shoot your foot, you must modify your gun with a GPS system for targeting and hire some guy named "Indy" to find the hookah bar and wire the coordinates back to you. By this time, you've probably become so daunted at the tasks stand between you and shooting your foot that you hire a guy who's read all the books on Sybase to help you shoot your foot. If you're lucky, he'll be smart enough both to find your foot and to stop you from shooting it. </p>
<p><strong>Magic software</strong>
    You spend 1 week looking up the correct syntax for GUN. When you find it, you realise that GUN will not let you shoot in your own foot. It will allow you to shoot almost anything but your foot. You then decide to build your own gun. You can't use the standard barrel since this will only allow for standard bullets, which will not fire if the barrel is pointed at your foot. After four weeks, you have created your own custom gun. It blows up in your hand without warning, because you failed to initialise the safety catch and it doesn't know whether the initial state is "0", 0, NULL, "ZERO", 0.0, 0,0, "0.0", or "0,00". You fix the problem with your remaining hand by nesting 12 safety catches, and then decide to build the gun without safety catch. You then shoot the management and retire to a happy life where you code in languages that will allow you to shoot your foot in under 10 days.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong>
    foot.shot(Gun.new)</p>
<p><strong>CSS</strong>
    You try to shoot your foot -- and made it on IE 7 but not IE 6.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl</strong>
    You first have to decide your object system, but by that time it already has one. You try to use <code>gun::shoot {foot::create}</code>, but you realize that you used braces instead of brackets. You spend hours staring at your code until you figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>StackOverflow</strong> To shoot yourself in the foot, ask a bad question and 5 people will come and shoot your foot.</p>
<p><strong>ASP .NET</strong>
    You discover that your client has your foot on his computer but the bullet is in the server database so you use SQL to extract the data for a Bullet object and create a gun class in C#.  Then you write some HTML so your client can see the gun.  You then discover that there are no controls for actually firing the gun at your foot through your client's browser so you create a mash-up of Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX to try and get the client's computer to shoot your foot.  10 languages, a million hours of testing/debugging, and 4 months later when your customer finally decides to run your web page, you learn that he is running IE6 and your new HTML5 code is not compatible with his old browser so the gun now appears to have two triggers.  The client runs the page anyway but the postback gets lost and you never actually know if your foot got shot or not.</p>

<p>We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Donald Knuth</p>
<p>The complete quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that the grail of
  efficiency leads to abuse. Programmers
  waste enormous amounts of time
  thinking about, or worrying about, the
  speed of noncritical parts of their
  programs, and these attempts at
  efficiency actually have a strong
  negative impact when debugging and
  maintenance are considered. <em>We should
  forget about small efficiencies, say
  about 97% of the time: premature
  optimization is the root of all evil.</em></p>
<p>Yet we should not pass up our
  opportunities in that critical 3%. A
  good programmer will not be lulled
  into complacency by such reasoning, he
  will be wise to look carefully at the
  critical code; but only after that
  code has been identified.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering?</p>
<p>A: Incompetent programmers. There are estimates that the number of programmers needed in the U.S. exceeds 200,000. This is entirely misleading. It is not a quantity problem; we have a quality problem. One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year. Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our perceived need for them. If we had more good programmers, and could easily identify them, we would need fewer, not more.</p>

              @John Gietzen: I often agree.  I find that when I have to write my own code, it matches my actual needs.  When I use other peoples&#39; code, I don&#39;t have to write the functionality I need - but I do need to translate between my actual needs, and the API of the code I&#39;m using.  Frequently, that reduces to trading an easy problem for a hard one. - <b> kyoryu</b>

<p>You know, when you have a program that
  does something really cool, and you
  wrote it from scratch, and it took a
  significant part of your life, you
  grow fond of it. When it's finished,
  it feels like some kind of amorphous
  sculpture that you've created. It has
  an abstract shape in your head that's
  completely independent of its actual
  purpose. Elegant, simple, beautiful.</p>
<p>Then, only a year later, after making
  dozens of pragmatic alterations to
  suit the people who use it, not only
  has your Venus-de-Milo lost both arms,
  she also has a giraffe's head sticking
  out of her chest and a cherubic penis
  that squirts colored water into a
  plastic bucket. The romance has become
  so painful that each day you struggle
  with an overwhelming urge to smash the
  f---ing thing to pieces with a hammer.</p>

              @allyourcode True, but I would say alot of what is discussed in that article are not things you can really look up anyway.  It is not so much memorizing facts, but developing skills.  Yes, you can look up how to use Win32 API, but the point of the article seems that someone who has done real world implementations will have more foresight when designing and planning future implementations.  This is more about the value of experience, which can&#39;t be looked up.  This is especially true of articles about &quot;best practices&quot;, because without prior experience you generally can&#39;t apply them correctly. - <b> AaronLS</b>

              @AaronLS On the other hand, alot of that experience does comes from looking stuff up &quot;in a book&quot; (or on the web). Sure, there are certain details that you shouldn&#39;t try to memorize, but a significant chunk of all knowledge can be found in books, the web, etc. If you never memorized any such things, you&#39;d spend practically all your time looking them up. - <b> allyourcode</b>

              The quote isn&#39;t saying that you shouldn&#39;t learn, or shouldn&#39;t have read the books in the first place.

              Defining any indexes you want is just super confusing, and almost totally useless. It&#39;s worse than totally useless if things thus defined can be passed as parameters to places where there definition is not in lexical scope. - <b> Doug McClean</b>

                <p>Debugging code is at least twice as hard as writing it in the first place. Therefore, if you write a program as cleverly as possible you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. (Brian W. Kernighan)</p>
<p>Well over half of the time you spend working on a project (on the order of 70 percent) is spent thinking, and no tool, no matter how advanced, can think for you. Consequently, even if a tool did everything except the thinking for you -- if it wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the documentation, did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs, put them in boxes, and mailed them to your customers -- the best you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in productivity. In order to do better than that, you have to change the way you think.</p>
<p>There is not now, nor has there ever been, nor will there ever be, any programming language in which it is the least bit difficult to write bad code.</p>
<p>Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>

Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living.

<p>But for me, the big problem with "axe sharpening" is that it's 
recursive. In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s%5Fparadoxes" rel="nofollow">
Zeno's paradox
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> kind of way: You spend the first two thirds of the time allotted to accomplishing a task actually working on the tool. But working on the tool is itself a task that involves tools: to sharpen the axe, you need a sharpening stone. So you spend two-thirds of the sharpening time coming up with a good sharpening stone. But before you can do that you need to spend time finding the right stone. And before you can do that you need to go to the north coast of Baffin Island where you've heard the best stones for sharpening come from. But to get there, you need to build a dog sled....</p>

<li>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure.  Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.  ~Nathaniel S. Borenstein</li>

<li><p><em>And don't tell me there isn't one bit of difference between null and space,

<li><p><em>My assertion that we can do better with computer languages is a persistent belief and fond hope, but you'll note I don't actually claim to be either rational or right.  Except when it's convenient.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I try not to confuse roles and traits in my own life.  Being the Perl

<p>Apple's Welcome Kit for new hires has this written on the bottom of the box: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's work and there's your life's
  work. </p>
<p>The kind of work that has your

  work that you'd never compromise on.
  That you'd sacrifice a weekend for.
  You can do that kind of work at Apple.
  People don't come here to play it

<p>Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even
  then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.</p>
<p>Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually
  small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is
  frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big,
  use Rule 2 first.)</p>

Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
"Write in C."

As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers:
"Write in C."

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO's dead and buried,
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics!
Write in C.

If you've just spent nearly 30 hours
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
Only wimps use BASIC.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
Don't even mention COBOL.

                <p><strong>From Alan J. Perlis' "Epigrams in Programming"</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.</p>
<p>A program without a loop and a structured variable isn't worth writing.</p>
<p>Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.</p>
<p>In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think the only universal in the computing field is the fetch-execute cycle.</p>
<p>There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.</p>
<p>The eleventh commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.</p>
<p>Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for  misunderstanding: Hiding information implies a need to check communication.</p>
<p>Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines include subroutines); seek it everywhere.</p>
<p>If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.</p>

    The main argument in favor of P ≠ NP is the total lack of fundamental progress in the area of exhaustive search. This is, in my opinion, a very weak argument. The space of algorithms is very large and we are only at the beginning of its exploration. [. . .] The resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem also shows that very simply [sic] questions may be settled only by very deep theories.

    Being attached to a speculation is not a good guide to research planning. One should always try both directions of every problem. Prejudice has caused famous mathematicians to fail to solve famous problems whose solution was opposite to their expectations, even though they had developed all the methods required.

<p>It can scarcely be denied that the
  supreme goal of all theory is to make
  the irreducible basic elements as
  simple and as few as possible without
  having to surrender the adequate
  representation of a single datum of
  experience. -Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been requoted as "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." but I've never seen where he was actually been documented as saying exactly that.</p>
<p>There are two facets of this quote that relate to software development and maintaining a balance between complexity and simplicity.</p>
<p>The key thing not to miss is "as simple as possible" or "without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum" means that sacrifices should not be made in the name of simplification which would result in over-simplification.</p>
<p>Never make a solution more complex because it feels more clever.  Sometimes in the face of a deadline, it could also mean don't make something more complex trying to satisfy non-existent "what if" requirements.  The "What if our [insert software used by 10 internal staff] goes commercial and we need to provide it in 20 different languages?"  Reusability and generalization can be good, but there is a sweet spot of balance between the extra effort becoming wasteful, and the lack of effort creating future challenges.</p>
<p>There are those developers who sometimes don't completely feel out all the scenarios their software will encounter, and then there is the flip side where you have overly passionate developers that sometimes make things far more complex than necessary.  Both of which have a lot to gain from this quote.</p>

<p>A lot of code would be better if programmers kept this creed.  Comments are all too often a crutch for bad code.  And, of course, if your code is easy to understand sans comments, there is no risk of the comments and the code diverging.</p>

              comments are often required to indicate WHY you are doing something instead of WHAT it is that you are doing. In that sense, I would say comments are necessary. But I do understand the idea behind the saying. The WHAT part of the code should not need comments. - <b> Mostlyharmless</b>

              Pike is wrong. This might be true if everyone who would ever read the code would be a genius in said language. There are project managers, new hires, the guy maintaining the code when the language becomes a legacy language(as C now is), etc. - <b> WolfmanDragon</b>

              I agree with WolfmanDragon. If code didn&#39;t need any comments, it would be English (or the viewer&#39;s native language). The fact that it isn&#39;t in English means judicious use of comments may have value. And even stuff written in English isn&#39;t always understandable. - <b> Bernard Dy</b>

              Most of my comments indicate why something was done. WHY? Because a lot of the time I&#39;m integrating with third party systems that have &quot;interesting&quot; ideas about how things work. One I&#39;m working on at the moment looks like what I&#39;d imagine a web service would look like if someone explained it to a small child, who in turn explained it to the developer that implemented it. - <b> Colin Mackay</b>

              I prefer another statement of this that is also (more or less) in this list: when you are about to write a comment, ask yourself if you can rewrite the code so the comment is not necessary. If you can, do it. If not, you need the comment. - <b> Permaquid</b>

                <p>I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification,
design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor
of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation.
We still make syntax errors, to be sure; but they are fuzz compared to the
conceptual errors in most systems.
If this is true, building software will always be hard. There is
inherently no silver bullet.</p>

              Is he suggesting that he didn&#39;t make a silly assumption based on the capabilities of the CPU he was coding for?  In that case, we&#39;re left with two other possible explanations for the 640K limit:

a) He did it for shits and giggles;
b) He wanted to retard the development of the PC by about 10 years. - <b> Ant</b>

              No, the reality is far worse - he was coding for a 16 bit processor, which already had paging issues to deal with more than 64k of RAM, and the BIOS and peripherals needed about 384k, and the processor could only physically handle 1MB. - <b> Adam Davis</b>
