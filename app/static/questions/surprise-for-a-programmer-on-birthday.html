          <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>hey everyone! sorry it has taken me so long to post pics. the cake was a HUGE success and he enjoyed every bite. but most of all, he loved the "actionscript birthday message" that graced the top of it! i wanted to thank you all for your suggestions. i have printed them and will make many more "coded" cakes as the holidays go by. i really want to do the heart "equation" for valentines day! i took peter toroks idea and tailored it for andrew's birthday cake (i asked a programmer to help me make it fit on the cake!). needless to say, andrew and all of his programmer buddies got a kick out of it and gobbled up the dark chocolate, peanut butter cake that was underneath all that nerdy icing-y goodness! here is proof:</p>
<p>the cake! </p>

                    @Daniel Lew: And what&#39;s right is following the SO guidelines, which state that questions related to programming that are of interest to programmers are welcome here.

                    @Chuck: In my opinion, a question having a programming flavor does not make it necessarily relevant for the site.  But I honestly don&#39;t care that much; people after me can read the SO FAQ as well as this blog post (<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun/" rel="nofollow">blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun</a>) and make up their own minds on whether they want to vote to close. - <b> Daniel Lew</b>

                    @Daniel:  This is explicitly intended to be a community-run site.  This means that, within limits, that which is popular is right.  Whether this question should be closed or not depends on one&#39;s definition of &quot;programming-related&quot; (it meets my definition of programming-related) or perhaps &quot;subjective and argumentative&quot; (and I&#39;m not seeing any arguing), so I think it&#39;s reasonable to vote either way. - <b> David Thornley</b>

                    @Beska You raise a good point.  The rating system of SO is clearly flawed.  I&#39;ve been an periodic poster here, and have both asked and answered a few genuine technical questions.  I have 9 badges.  One of them is a yearling badge.  Now a non-technical female posts a single off topic question and ends up with almost as much rep and more badges literally overnight.  I&#39;m not crying about the size of my e-peen here, but it doesn&#39;t seem right that penelope ends up looking more valuable to the SO community than many knowledgeable and helpful developers.  Is it SO, or do we just need to get out more? - <b> rotard</b>

                    Most programmers have a fatal flaw: overthinking things. The number of times this has been closed and reopened only confirms that fact.

If so, turn off the computer and go find a hobby other than being pissy on programming websites. - <b> MattC</b>

              @Penelope - oh it&#39;s not flash as in Flash, it&#39;s a joke because back when the web was young you could make text flash on and off like that, but then because it was widely abused the feature was removed and to make text flash on and off you have to do it the second way now - and it doesn&#39;t work in all browsers. - <b> Cruachan</b>

                <p>In combination with these any of these answers, you could put just five candles on the cake.  Light the first two, leave the next two unlit, and then light the last one.  This is the binary representation of 25.  Besides being geeky, it will leave more space on the cake for your writing/drawing too.</p>

                <p>Awww! That's adorable.
There is no code for Happy Birthday, But you could write his age in binary and put a goto before it. It's not real code together, but it gets the message across, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>                                      GOTO
                                     011001
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the windows calculator in expert mode for getting the age into binary with a single click. The above is binary for 25 (since you mentioned he'd turn that in a comment).</p>

                <p>The cake was a HUGE success and he enjoyed every bite. But most of all, he loved the "actionscript birthday message" that graced the top of it! I wanted to thank you all for your suggestions. I have printed them and will make many more "coded" cakes as the holidays go by. I really want to do the heart "equation" for valentines day! I took 
Péter Török's idea and tailored it for Andrew's birthday cake (I asked a programmer to help me make it fit on the cake!). Needless to say, Andrew and all of his programmer buddies got a kick out of it and gobbled up the dark chocolate, peanut butter cake that was underneath all that nerdy icing-y goodness! Here is proof:</p>

              Thank you :) My wife saw your topic here, ordered it at Baskin Robbins (cake with Hokey Pokey ice cream). They failed for 2 times though. First they didn&#39;t get the characters right, the ampersand became an <code>e</code> and the semicolon became a <code>j</code>. In a second attempt they put the semicolon at the wrong line (which has been corrected as you can see at the picture). So, be warned whenever you order a cake with &quot;weird&quot; characters! ;) - <b> BalusC</b>

              Who cares if it is a guy? This is a question plenty of people would probably want to know an answer to. It could easily go the other way of the guy is getting his girlfriend/fiancee/wife a geeky cake. I&#39;d understand the angle if he was faking a girl just to get a bigger reaction. Truth be told, more people are willing to help out women then men, regardless of the social group. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some study out there about that. - <b> The Jug</b>

              it reverse the string. For Example if string is 123 initially it convert into 321. so it will reverse the string yadhtribyppah to happybirthday. The same thing is happening in my other answer but with different reverse logic.  - <b> Adeel</b>
