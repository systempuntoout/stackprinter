<p>There's been a cluster of Perl-hate on Stack Overflow lately, so I thought I'd bring my "<a href="http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/32556" rel="nofollow">
Five things you hate about your favorite language
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>" question to Stack Overflow. Take your favorite language and tell me five things you hate about it. Those might be things that just annoy you, admitted design flaws, recognized performance problems, or any other category. You just have to hate it, and it has to be your favorite language.</p>
<p>Don't compare it to another language, and don't talk about languages that you already hate. Don't talk about the things you like in your favorite language. I just want to hear the things that you hate but tolerate so you can use all of the other stuff, and I want to hear it about the language you wished other people would use.</p>
<p>I ask this whenever someone tries to push their favorite language on me, and sometimes as an interview question. If someone can't find five things to hate about his favorite tool, he doesn't know it well enough to either advocate it or pull in the big dollars using it. He hasn't used it in enough different situations to fully explore it. He's advocating it as a culture or religion, which means that if I don't choose his favorite technology, I'm wrong.</p>
<p>I don't care that much which language you use. Don't want to use a particular language? Then don't. You go through due diligence to make an informed choice and still don't use it? Fine. Sometimes the right answer is "You have a strong programming team with good practices and a lot of experience in Bar. Changing to Foo would be stupid."</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a good question for code reviews too. People who really know a codebase will have all sorts of suggestions for it, and those who don't know it so well have non-specific complaints. I ask things like "If you could start over on this project, what would you do differently?" In this fantasy land, users and programmers get to complain about anything and everything they don't like. "I want a better interface", "I want to separate the model from the view", "I'd use this module instead of this other one", "I'd rename this set of methods", or whatever they really don't like about the current situation. That's how I get a handle on how much a particular developer knows about the codebase. It's also a clue about how much of the programmer's ego is tied up in what he's telling me.</p>
<p>Hate isn't the only dimension of figuring out how much people know, but I've found it to be a pretty good one. The things that they hate also give me a clue how well they are thinking about the subject.</p>

                    This is a fantastic question. If you&#39;re wondering what some language is like, reading 3 different replies about it on this page would be <i>easily</i> the best useful-information-for-time-spent you could find. Also a great way to gauge a programmer&#39;s experience (and humility) levels if you already know the language. - <b> j_random_hacker</b>

                    Well, the question certainly provokes a response, if not a real answer. Five things... why five? Anyway, I agree that inability to find a defect in one&#39;s favourite language can indeed show one&#39;s lack of knowledge of the tool. When I first read the title, I thought: &quot;Right, I may dislike something in Delphi, but why <i>hate</i>?&quot; But after I read the point mentioned I could see its validity: my knowledge of Delphi is really incomplete, quite incomplete. And yet when I have started hating something in my favourite language, I wonder how long I will be allowing myself to call it my <i>favourite</i>... - <b> Andriy M</b>

              @MusiGenesis, I like point 5. However, I have to disagree. Most of the compilers don&#39;t syntax check on compilation but instead raise errors at runtime. Most don&#39;t even raise errors, they just execute the bad code unpredictably. Don&#39;t get me started on the lack of error-checking in the transmission. - <b> Tom Leys</b>

              English actually <i>does</i> have a second person plural pronoun: &quot;you&quot;. 200+ y. ago, the English started using &quot;you&quot; as a respectful &quot;thou&quot; imitating French &quot;vous&quot;. Soon they treated everyone respectfully. Then forgot about &quot;thou&quot;, so &quot;you&quot; became the only word for both second persons. - <b> Joe Pineda</b>

              The same is happening in Latin America: Spanish here lost &quot;vosotros&quot; (familiar &quot;you&quot;), our friends we might call &quot;tu&quot; alone, yet altogether they always deserve respect. Portuguese lost both &quot;tu&quot; (thou) and &quot;vos&quot; (familiar you). So in Brazil people always address each other in the respect form. - <b> Joe Pineda</b>

<li>It's difficult to implement relational division. </li>
<li>I can set a value to NULL, but I can't test it for equality with NULL. I can check IS NULL, but that just complicates code -- needlessly so, in my opinion. </li>

              SQL isn&#39;t a shining example of language design, but many constraints are imposed on the architecture by query optimisation and the mechanical component to database operations.  SSDs notwithstanding, database development is more or less unique in that SQL is a declarative language controlling operations with a mechanical component - disk heads moving and rotational latency.

              The necessity of IS NULL should be clear, if you consider that NULL is a third possible result, right after TRUE and FALSE. Since it&#39;s meaning is &quot;unknown&quot; you can not tell if something which is unknown matches another thing which is unknown as well. Another example: if NULL equals NULL this would mean that the whole concept of making JOINs would be impossible, since any NULL value could be matched to another NULL value. If you understand this (what also is called ternary logic) than you might understand the reason for introducing the &quot;IS&quot; operator for testing against NULL. - <b> Vash</b>

              Vash is right. Another (easier to digest?) way of putting it: if you made NULL = NULL, then you don&#39;t <i>remove</i> weirdness from the language, you just push it into other, even more inconvenient places. - <b> j_random_hacker</b>

              I would like an argument for #3. In some cases it makes perfect sense (to me) for numbers and strings to share a similar operator that does something different to each.

              @Chris: Yes, &quot;+&quot; is a good operator for concatenation in a strongly typed language (like Python). In a weakly typed language (like Javascript or C) it is terrible; it decides (silently!) that &#39;sum: &#39;+2+3 is not &#39;sum: 5&#39; but &#39;sum: 23&#39;.

              Yes, C is weakly typed, compared to, say, Python (e.g. you can assign integers to <code>char</code>s, cast anything to anything via void* pointers, etc.) It is <i>statically</i> typed instead of <i>dynamically</i> typed, and also requires <i>explicit</i> typing instead of type inference, but those are unrelated to strong v/s weak typing. [Random examples: Python has implicit dynamic strong typing, Haskell has (optionally explicit) static strong typing, Java has explicit (mostly static) strong typing, C has explicit static (relatively weak) typing.] &quot;Strongly typed&quot; and &quot;weakly typed&quot; are actually not well-defined. - <b> ShreevatsaR</b>

              Disagree with mostly everything: There are very few incompatibilities between browsers on the language side of things, DOM is the problem. JavaScript can be very stylish, if you know what you&#39;re doing. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll scatter a lot of procedural code in html, rather than write nice OO code in js files, where it belongs. I would call it the best of both worlds if JavaScript added optional type checking with classes, as did ActionScript. - <b> Juan Mendes</b>

                <p>PHP:</p>
<p>1) Forces me to make unnecessary variables:</p>
<pre><code>$parts = explode('|', $string);
$first = $parts[0];
</code></pre>
<p>2) An implementation of lambdas so lame it is roughly equivalent to using eval() and so hidiously wrong I have never used it (see <a href="http://www.php.net/create_function" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/create_function</a>).</p>
<p>3) A try/catch system which can only catch about 80% of errors that might occur.</p>
<p>4) Regex support just as lame as lambda support because it has to be written inside regular strings, making one of the most hard-to-learn programming tools about three times as difficult. And PHP is supposed to be an "easy" language?!?!?</p>
<p>5) No way to safely pull stuff out of $_POST without writing it twice or building your own function, or using the '@' operator:</p>
<pre><code>$x = isset($_POST['foo']['bar']) ? $_POST['foo']['bar'] : null;
</code></pre>
<p>6) Bonus answer: '@'. If you can't be bothered writing your code correctly, just add '@', and too bad for anyone who has to debug your code later.</p>

              It&#39;s funny looking at this, because almost all these gripes have been addressed in newer versions of PHP. Mainly real lambdas and the ternary shortcut operator. Also, by setting a simple error handler, you can convert all PHP errors (notices, warnings, etc) to Exceptions, so they can be caught by try/catch blocks. - <b> jason</b>

              @too much php, consider fatal errors to compiler errors. In languages like Java and C# if you leave a semicolon out or make a syntax error which doesn&#39;t let it compile, you would get a compiler error the same way you get fatal errors in php - <b> Click Upvote</b>

              @Click Upvote: But Fatal errors are not the same as compile errors - if you have <code>null</code> instead of an object than trying to call a method results in a Fatal Error.

              @Eric: for most classes, deriving doesn&#39;t make sense and most classes actually support it poorly.

hashCode/equals: it sucks in Java too. One day I&#39;ll write a long blog post about it. Read Effective Java for details of why equals is hard in inheritance chains. - <b> Jon Skeet</b>

              Sealing by default means that you have thought of every possible reason that someone may want to inherit from your class and you don&#39;t think any of them make sense.  Sorry, but none of us are that smart. - <b> Ed S.</b>

              In that case I&#39;m not smart enough for you to derive from my code: because I can&#39;t predict what future changes I might make which could break your code. That&#39;s a very significant problem, IMO. Sealing the code is more restrictive, but leads to more implementation freedom and robustness. - <b> Jon Skeet</b>

              The biggest problem I have with classes being sealed is the difficulty in mocking them for Fitnesse or Unit tests.  The biggest example that comes to mind is HttpContext - it can&#39;t be extended, and only implements IServiceProvidor.  If I want to mock a call to a function that takes an HttpContext, it would be nice to pass in a MockHttpContext that extends/overrides HttpContext. Instead, you have to create an instance of HttpContext and populate it, and there&#39;s no way to spy what functions were called. Even Rhino Mock can&#39;t deal with a sealed class. - <b> Matt Poush</b>

              @Matt: To me, that says that HttpContext should implement a suitable interface, not that it should be unsealed.

However, in practice I doubt that sealed by default would make our lives any better.  In my own code I wouldn&#39;t care because I can change it as I see fit (I don&#39;t develop public libraries).  Unfortunately, elegantly designed third party API&#39;s are the exception, not the rule.  So, what does this mean?

Yep, Mutex is heavy.

But managing lock tokens involves more information and actions that can be mishandled while lock introduces only one more variable handling per lock (and that&#39;s definitely easier). And we always can implement tokens support system if we really need them in a project :)

Concerning syntax, well, there are pros and cons of equal weight: keyword (bad as it is, yet better readability), brackets (more indentation, yet we have better view of what is being locked), some strange variable doing some strange business inside :) - <b> terR0Q</b>

                <p>How about five things I hate about "Things I hate about some language" lists? :D</p>
<p><strong>5- Painting an orange red doesn't make it an apple.</strong></p>
<p>When a language is designed, the designers typically have in mind what it's useful for. Using it for something completely different <em>can</em> work, but complaining when it doesn't is just dumb. Take Python. I'm sure either someone has or someone will some day make a utility to create exe's from Python code. Why on God's earth would you <em>want</em> to do that? It would be neat&mdash;don't get me wrong&mdash;but it has no use. So stop complaining about it!</p>
<p>A well-designed project would likely contain code from multiple languages. That's not to say you cannot complete a project with only one language. Some projects may be well within the abilities of whatever language you are using.</p>
<p><strong>4- Are you standing on wooden legs?</strong></p>
<p>The platform can be a large influence of what the language can do. With nowadays garbage collectors, or well even pascals early attempt at "garbage collection", can aid in memory fade (maybe malloc more ram??). Computers are faster and so of course, we expect more out of our languages. And quite frankly, we probably should. However, there is a huge price to pay for the convenience of the compiler to create hash tables or strings or a variety of other concepts. These things may not be inherit to the platform of which they are used. To say they are easy to include to a language just tells me you may not have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p><strong>3- Who's fault is it really?</strong></p>
<p>Bugs. You know. I love bugs. Why do I love bugs. Because it means I get to keep my job. Without bugs, there would be many closed pizza shops. However, users hate bugs. But here is a little splash of cold water. Every bug <em>is</em> the programmers fault. Not the language's. A language with such a strict syntax that would significantly reduce how many bugs were possible to generated would be a completely useless language. It's abilities could probably be counted on one hand. You want flexibility or power? You've got bugs. Why? Because you're not perfect, and you make mistakes. Take a really identifiable example in C:</p>
<pre><code>int a[10];
for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; 15; idx++) a[idx] = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>We all know what that's going to do. However, what maybe some of us don't realize is.. that functionality can be very beneficial. Depending on what you are doing. Buffer overruns are the cost of that functionality. That code above. If I actually released that to the public. That's again.. say it with me.. "My fault". Not C's for allowing me to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2- Shouldn't we put that in the recycle bin?</strong></p>
<p>It's very easy to point at a feature in a language we don't understand because we don't use it often and call it stupid. Complain that it's there etc. Goto's always entertain me. People always complain about goto's being in a language. Yet I bet your last program included a type of goto. If you have ever used a break or a continue, you've used a goto. That's what it is. Granted, it's a "safe" goto, but it is what it is. Goto's have their uses. Whether "implicit" gotos like continue or break are used or explicit gotos (using the actual keyword "goto" for whatever language). Not that language developers are flawless, but typically... if functionality has existed since the dawn of time (for that language). Likely that aspect is a defining quality of that language. Meaning.. it's being used and likely is not hanging around because of backwards compatibility. It's being used today. As in 5 minutes ago. And used properly. Well.. arguably someone is using it improperly as well, but that relates to #3 on my list.</p>
<p><strong>1. - Everything is an object.</strong></p>
<p>Ok.. this one is really a subset of #2. But this is by far the most annoying complaint I see in hate lists. Not everything is an object. There are a great many of concepts that do not belong or need to be objects. Putting things where they don't belong is just ugly and can decrease efficiency of a program. Sure. Maybe not much depending on the language. This also relates to #5. This means... yes. Global are ok. Functions as apposed to static methods are ok. Combining OO programming with global functions is ok. Now.. that doesn't mean we should all go out and "free" our code from it's object models either. When designing a section of code or a whole project, what happens behind the scenes <em>should</em> be considered when putting it together. Not only where that concept lives and many other factors. Why wrap global functions within classes or name space concepts if it serves no purpose? Take static member variables. That greatly amuses me because.. well..Depending on the language and implementation of course, but generally speaking, you just declared a global. Yes, there are some reasons to wrap these non-OO concepts in OO wrappers. One of course being self documenting code. That can make sense. So.. like I say. Don't go out and "free" your code. But any good modern language will have a global concept outside of it's OO modeling. Yes I'm specifically meaning to point out that an OO programming language without a global concept most likely has a serious design flaw. Again though.. depends on the intention and design of the language so I'm not attempting to pick on any specific language and there are far too many to analyze right here. Anywho, Consider where the code should live and be the most effective. Adding a bunch of flare to something which doesn't add functionality or support just wears down the keyboard faster. It doesn't do anybody any good. Well.. unless you like brownie points from the person who probably incorrectly taught you that everything is an object.</p>
<p>In short, programming isn't just mindlessly tapping on the keyboard. There are a lot of design considerations to any project. I know it's cliche, but you have to look at it from every angle. Even with nowadays type-safe languages. You don't just chuck code out and expect it to work well. Sure.. it may work, but it may not be the right way to go about it. Overall, pick the language and format that is best suited for the specific job AND the environment. But <em>no</em> language takes away the thought behind it. If you're not thinking.. you're just typing.</p>

              Languages aren&#39;t perfect, and if you make a list of things you hate about a language, you may get some interesting comments and ideas. First, it allows others to give you solutions which you didn&#39;t know existed (look through the posts, you will see a few things were learned). Second, it constitutes user feedback for the language developers (wouldn&#39;t you be interested if your users came up with a list of the 5 things they hate the most about your software?), and third, it&#39;s kinda interesting to ponder on the flaws of your tools.  - <b> Sylverdrag</b>

              And what <i>aren&#39;t</i> objects? Everything down to the atom and whatever is under that is an object, likewise for conceptual objects. Globals <b>are</b> bad (or any state for that matter). They can be convenient in certain situations, but they should be used conservatively. Every time you add more state, your program gains (exponentially) more bugs. Continue is a goto? Maybe, but then every statement could be a goto to the next statement.

                <p>Five things I hate about <strong>Java</strong> (which, presently, is my favorite language) in no particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li>As much as I am a fan of Java Generics, there are a lot of oddities that arise from the way it was designed.  As such there a myriad of annoying limitations with generics (some of which are the result of type-erasure).</li>
<li>The way Object.clone() and the Cloneable interfaces work is totally broken.</li>
<li>Instead of taking the high-road and making everything an object (a.la. SmallTalk), Sun wimped out created two distinct categories of data-types: Objects and primitives.  As a result there are now <em>two</em> representations for fundamental data types and wierd curiosities such as boxing/unboxing and not being able to put primitives in a Collection.</li>
<li>Swing is too complex.  Don't get me wrong: there's a lot of cool stuff one can do with Swing but it is a great example of over-engineering.</li>
<li>This final complaint is equally the fault of Sun and those whom have written XML libraries for Java.  Java XML libraries are way too complicated.  In order to simply read in an XML file, I often have to worry about what parser I am using: DOM or SAX? The APIs for each is equally confusing.  Native support in the language for <strong>easily</strong> parsing/writing XML would be very nice.</li>
<li>java.util.Date sucks.  Not only is it unnecessarily complicated but all the <strong>useful</strong> methods have been deprecated (and replaced with others that increase complexity).</li>

              DOM and SAX are two inherently different approaches to parsing XML.   One is document-based (i.e. read the whole doc in, and then manipulate it) vs stream-based (react to tokens as they are seen in the input- much better for larger documents).  But I&#39;ll grant you that using them both can be a PITA, especially since they&#39;re implemented via &quot;service provider&quot; interfaces.

                <p><strong>Ruby</strong> has many flaws related to its speed, but I don't hate those. It also has flaws with the community evangelism going overboard, but that doesn't really bother me. These are what I hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closures (blocks) have 4 different creation syntaxes, and none of them are optimal. The elegant syntax is incomplete and ambiguous with hashes, and the full syntax is ugly.</li>
<li>The community tends to be against real documentation, favoring ‘read the code’. I find this childish and lazy.</li>
<li>Metaprogramming abuse, particularly in libraries, makes bugs a nightmare to track down.</li>
<li>On a related note, pervasive metaprogramming makes a comprehensive IDE difficult, if not impossible, to make.</li>
<li><p>The way block passing to functions is done is silly. There is no reason blocks should be passed outside the parameter list, or have odd special syntax to access (yield). I am of the opinion that blocks should have been given a less ambiguous syntax (or hashes could have used different delimiters; perhaps &lt;> rather than {}), and passing as parameters to methods should have been just like all other parameters.</p>
<pre><code>object.method(1, {|a| a.bar}, "blah")
</code></pre>
<p>These oddities, like the block must be the last parameter passed and passing more than one block is different with longer syntax, really annoy me.</p></li>

              1. Global variables (especially, class/module names) which cuts possibility to load several versions of the same library
2. Mutable string literals (you have to write Cblah = &quot;blah&quot;.freeze to optimize GC)
3. Operators are not methods (!=, !~, !, if, while), so you cannot do 100% proper proxies and futures

              Re documentation, I once heard a talk by someone working at the Pragmatic Programmers publishing house, who said that when the company was founded, they wanted a Ruby book because the only one that was available was in Japanese.  So they could have had that book translated and published by their company.

              I think it may be that there&#39;s an inherent tradeoff between language power and IDE power. Making a language more expressive may place hard limits on how much help an IDE can provide. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll go for language power every time because I&#39;ve found that powerful IDEs help a lot more for writing code than reading it, and I do more of the latter. - <b> Zak</b>

                <p>I'll do <strong>PHP</strong> as I like it at times and Python will be done way too much.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No namespace; everything is in a
kind of very big namespace which is
hell in bigger environments</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of standards when it comes to
functions: array functions take a
needle as a first argument, haystack
as second (see <a href="http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php" rel="nofollow">
array_search
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>).
String functions often take the
haystack first, needle second (see
<a href="http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php" rel="nofollow">
strpos
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[2]</sup>). Other functions just
use different naming schemes:

</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[5]</sup> </p>
<p>Some functions have weird return
values, out of what is normal: This
forces you to have a third variable
declared out of nowhere while PHP
could efficiently interpret an empty
array as false with its type
juggling. There are near no other
functions doing the same.</p>
<pre><code>$var = preg_match_all('/regexp/', $str, $ret);
echo $var; //outputs the number of matches 
print_r($ret); //outputs the matches as an array
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The language (until PHP6) does its
best to respect a near-retarded
backward compatibility, making it
carry bad practices and functions
around when not needed (see
<a href="http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-escape-string.php" rel="nofollow">
mysql_escape_string
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[6]</sup> vs.
<a href="http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php" rel="nofollow">
mysql_real_escape_string
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[7]</sup>).</p></li>
<li><p>The language evolved from a
templating language to a
full-backend one. This means anybody
can output anything when they want,
and it gets abused. You end up with
template engines for a templating
language...</p></li>
<li><p>It sucks at importing files. You
have 4 different ways to do it
(include, include_once, require,
require_once), they are all slow,
very slow.  In fact the whole
language is slow. At least, pretty
slower than python (even with a
framework) and RoR from what I
gather.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I still like PHP, though. It's the chainsaw of web development: you want a small to medium site done real fast and be sure anybody can host it (although configurations may differ)? PHP is right there, and it's so ubiquitous it takes only 5 minutes to install a full LAMP or WAMP stack. Well, I'm going back to working with Python now...</p>

              The only thing I have to (sort of) disagree with is the weird return values. With the way PHP does it now, you can do if(preg_match_all(&quot;/regexp/&quot;, $str, $ret)) { print $ret; } (or if (preg...(...) &gt; 2) {...}, etc) which was probably the point. - <b> Andrew Koester</b>

              When returning an empty array, PHP will evaluate it to false with its loose typing. Returning the array itself would still let you like &quot;if($matches = preg_match_all($regexp,$str)){...}&quot;. Adding &#39;or&#39; after sounds like a pretty bad reason to have the return values that way. - <b> I GIVE TERRIBLE ADVICE</b>

              It is subjective, especially since the largest bottlenecks you have are about the network and how long it takes to render the page to the user (CSS, JS), which amounts to roughly 90% of the time taken to load a page.

              Lol funny answer just keep up with it and sound all smart pants, @Jonik, it is called tilde. Accent is the stronger intensity on a syllable when pronouncing it, tilde is the actual little mark that goes over any letter to specify it is pronounced different or to distinguish it from others. Of course, since tilde is most commonly used to denote accent, the word accent became a sort of synonym of the word tilde.  - <b> Francisco Noriega</b>

              @Roboprog This is due to the fact that everything in java is pass by value.

              People rejecting Python due to whitespace is the most retarded thing I can imagine. Braces are just redundant in C-like languages, since all good code is indented anyways. You don&#39;t even need to indent all the time in python, you can separate statements with semicolons (although, just like in C-like languages, nobody does this, because it&#39;s retarded) <code>print &#39;hurr&#39;; print &#39;durr&#39;</code>. Although I wish I could make anonymous functions/classes, which is natural with braces, but hardly any big deal, plus you can use lambdas a lot of the times for this. - <b> Longpoke</b>

              What&#39;s wrong with underscored keywords? Python does its best to stay out of <i>your</i> namespaces.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strings.</strong><br />
They are not interoperable with platform strings, so you end up using std::vector half of the time. The copy policy (copy on write or deep copy) is not defined, so performance guarantees can not be given for straightforward syntax. Sometimes they rely on STL algorithms that are not very intuitive to use. Too many libraries roll their own which are unfortunately much more comfortable to use. Unless you have to combine them. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variety of string representations</strong><br />
Now, this is a little bit of a platform problem - but I still hope it would have been better when a less obstinate standard string class would have been available earlier. The following string representations I use frequently: </p>
<ul>
<li>generic LPCTSTR, </li>
<li>LPC(W)STR allocated by CoTaskMemAlloc, </li>
<li>BSTR, _bstr _t</li>
<li>(w)string, </li>
<li>CString, </li>
<li>std::vector</li>
<li>a roll-my-own class (<em>sigh</em>)  that adds range checking and basic operations to a (w)char * buffer of known length</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Build model.</strong><br />
I am sick to death of all the time spent muddling around with who-includes-what, forward declarations, optimizing precompiled headers and includes to keep at least incremental build times bearable, etc. It was great in the eighties, but now? There are so many hurdles to packing up a piece of code so it can be reused that even moms dog gets bored listening to me.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hard to parse</strong><br />
This makes external tools especially hard to write, and get right. And today, we C++ guys are lacking mostly in the tool chain. I love my C# reflection and delegates but I can live without them. Without great refactoring, I can't.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Threading is too hard</strong><br />
Language doesn't even recognize it (by now), and the freedoms of the compiler - while great - are to painful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static and on-demand initialization</strong>
Technically, I cheat here: this is another puzzle piece in the "wrap up code for reuse": It's a nightmare to get something initialized only when it is needed. The best solution to all other redist problems is throwing everything into headers, this problem says "neeener - you cannot".</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Granted, a lot of that is beyond strict language scope, but IMO the entire toolchain needs to be judged and needs to evolve. </p>

              Frankly, most of these points sound like you never quite bothered to learn C++ properly... this gets rather obvious in #3, since inclusion guards are something that <i>every</i> C++ programmer should know.

              @nebukadnezzar: I found Meyers illuminating on the STL, but it doesn&#39;t solve the fundamental problems. Frankly, this sounds like you never had to maintain a large project, you never had to hunt down a circular dependency in a dozens-deep include hierarchy. I know include guards, but why do we have to bother with them? BTW. they don&#39;t fix every problem. How &quot;standard&quot; is a <code>std::string</code> if I can&#39;t use it half of the time?

The string class allows you to access the string data as <code>const char*</code> via <code>std::string::c_str</code>, which already makes <code>std::string</code> perfectly compatible with every class/function that also takes <code>const char*</code> arguments. - <b> nebukadnezzar</b>

              The lack of object closure and the fact null !== undefined doesn&#39;t confuse <i>me</i> either, but they&#39;re still design flaws, as well as a plentiful source of confusion with <i>other</i> programmers (whose code I then have to fix).

              Seriously.. the &quot;Cryptic syntax&quot; point is valid, but should refer to actual syntax (i.e: type declarations) to get the point across. For example: <code>char *(*(**foo [][8])())[];</code> Not to mention the standard library is a useless piece of crap. &quot;No function overloading&quot; is also a pretty bad point... C is meant to be a portable assembler, <i>not</i> an OO language. - <b> Longpoke</b>

              @Longpoke - no one considers assembler more intuitive than C. You can&#39;t be serious. Hate C, OK. But implying assembler is somehow easier than C is disingenuous. Have you ever looked at the assembler output of a good C compiler? - <b> xcramps</b>

              @xcramps, The <i>syntax</i>, not semantics, (although the semantics are equivalent to a very well documented library). Take C vs the style of Intel x86: in C, a pointer dereference is <code>*x</code>, while in x86, it&#39;s <code>[x]</code>. Now imagine if you could expand that how Ollydbg does. double dereference would be <code>[[x]]</code>, while in C it&#39;s <code>**x</code>. call  deref would be <code>[x]()</code>, while in C it would be <code>(*x)()</code>. func pointer declaration: <code>[int function(int a, [float] b)] x</code>, vs <code>int (*x)(int a, float* b) x</code>. clearly the former is superior. heck anything is better than C syntax. - <b> Longpoke</b>

              @Eric, Norman, Apocalisp: If you flip the associativity of $ it can be used to delimit multiple arguments. <code>f $ x y z $ quux quaffle</code> becomes <code>f (x y z) (quux quaffle)</code>, the utility of the right-associative $ is still present, because if you wanted the other meaning for that you can use <code>f . x y z $ quux quaffle</code>. - <b> Edward Kmett</b>

<ul><li><strong>Runtime.exec().</strong>  So, if I don't manually clear the STDOUT and STDERR buffers, my code will hang?  Wow.  Die, plz.</li>
<li><strong>Null Pointer Exceptions.</strong>  Responsible programming means I have to treat most objects like they're unexploded bombs, which is kind of a pisser in an object-oriented language.  And when the inevitable happens I kinda need to know <em>which</em> object blew up in my face, but Java apparently feels telling me would be cheating.</li>
<li><strong>File I/O.</strong>  Why do I have to jump through this many hoops to read a dang text file?  And when copying files, I have to funnel the source file into my code and manually handle the output byte buffer?  You're serious?</li>
<li><strong>Primitives vs. Primitive Wrappers.</strong>  Note that Java now has a number of features that allow you to treat primitives and their wrapper objects as interchangeable in some places, but not in others; don't worry, the compiler will let you know which is which.  This feels like a hack to work around a fundamentally broketastic design decision.  And it is.  (<b>EDIT:</b>  Actually, the compiler is a much crappier safety net than I thought, particular when doing equality checks.  If `a` and `b` are integers, `a == b` is guaranteed to behave as expected only if at least one of them is of type `int`.  If they're both type `Integer`, then that statement will do what you think only if the two numbers are between -128 and 127.  `Integer a = 1000; Integer b = 1000; return a == b;` will return `false`.  Really.)</li>

<li>I'm in general not a huge fan of the do/end style semantics. I much prefer C-style braces.</li>

<ul>
<li>Again, dynamic typing.</li>
<li>Lack of closures. I know, you can do <code>$function($arg);</code> but that doesn't count.</li>
<li>Yet again, variables can be used before being defined. I have a personal policy of always explicitly initializing any variable to a known value before I use it, and I extend that to whatever best practices documents I have any sort of control over.</li>

<li>Headers = pain in the neck. </li>
<li>No support for closures. (I'm excited for C++0x, which has them.)</li>
<li>Static typing. "Wait," you say. "You just said you don't like dynamic typing!" Yes, I did say that. But static typing can be a pain in the butt too. (If given a choice I'd still pick static typing.) Optimally I'd like a language that was statically typed by default, but supported a dynamic type as well.

<p>It's a great language, especially with LINQ, but <em>generics support is poor</em> compared to C++. It had so much potential, but the current implementation is only useful for strongly-typed collections and similar trivial things. Some examples of where it falls down:</p>
<ul>
<li>A generic argument cannot be restricted to enums (only classes or structs).</li>
<li>A generic argument cannot be a static class. Why? This seems like a completely artifical restriction.</li>
<li>You cannot specify that a generic type must have a constructor with a certain signature because you cannot have constructors on interfaces. Why not? It's just another method with the special name ".ctor".</li>
<li>Similarly, you cannot specify that a generic type must have a static method, because those also cannot be declared on interface. Something like <code>static T Parse(string s)</code> would often come in useful.</li>
<li>The compiler is too eager in prohibiting some casts which the programmer knows would actually work, so they require uglyness like <code>(TheRealType)(object)value</code></li>
<li>No covariance, eg. <code>IList&lt;string&gt;</code> cannot be converted to <code>IList&lt;object&gt;</code>, even though <code>string[]</code> can be converted to <code>object[]</code>. (Microsoft might be fixing this in C# 4.0, though.)</li>

<p>Although the weird way python deals with scope has been mentioned, the worst consequence of it, I feel, is that this is valid:</p>

def myFunction():

    if random.choice(True, False):
        myString = "blah blah blah"

<p>That is, inside the if block is the same scope as the rest of the function, meaning that variable declaration can occur inside condional branches, and be accessed outside of them. Most languages will either prevent you doing this, or at least offer you some kind of strict mode.</p>
<p>This function will sometimes succeed, and sometimes throw an exception. Although this is a contrived example, this could lead to some subtle problems.</p>

<li>Too slow!</li>
<li>list operations don't return the list, so you can't do list.append(4).append(5). (I mean a reference to the same list, not a copy). This is a minor gripe; it's only come up a few times.</li>
<li>statements don't return values (if, print, while, for, etc). This is only a problem when dealing with lambdas. </li>
<li>lambdas can only be one expression. There's no real need for this restriction, as they are equivalent to functions in every other way. What if I want a button press event which calls two functions? I'd need to create a named function to supply that functionality to an action listener, while doing "lambda: f1(); f2()" would not hurt.</li>
<li>you can only put standard a-zA-Z_0-9 as names. Having functions like "true?" and "+" would be great. Of course, this could lead to terrible obfuscation, but I'm not saying we immediately rename all functions to "p@$%3". Which do you find clearer to read: "dec2bin" or "dec->bin"?

 4.) Exception catching<br />
 3.) The Boolean type<br />
 2.) BigDecimal type<br />
 1.) C# fanboys and Java fanboys  </p>
<p><code>Boolean</code> can be null. I find this counterintuitive. </p>
<p><code>BigDecimal</code> is a library and not a language feature. My annoyance with <code>BigDecimal</code> and <code>Exception</code> catching stems mainly from writing test classes that have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get actual work done. I should clarify I'm annoyed by these things, I'm not about to lobby for changes.</p>

                <p>Here's some more for Perl 5, from the perspective of someone who's created a lot of Perl modules, and in particular worked on <a href="http://moose.perl.org" rel="nofollow">
Moose
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The horrible brokenness that is overloading and tied variables. Both of these features are a failed attempt to allow transparent extension to the built-in types.</p>
<p>They both fail in various ways, and require module authors like myself to either implement horrible hacks to support them, or to say "never pass an overloaded object to the foo() method". Neither alternative is really acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of proper hooks into the compilation process and the meta-model. Moose in general, and role usage in particular, could be made much safer if the Perl core allowed us to affect the compilation process via a sane API that allowed us to hook into the meta-model (packages, classes, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of named parameters built into the language. Instead, everyone reinvents this. It's annoying.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, lack of optional types. I don't want a static language, but the ability to specify types and constraints, particularly on function/method parameters, would be great. Perl 6 gets this right. Types are optional, but very rich, and there's no fundamental difference between built-in and user-defined types.</p></li>
<li><p>The backwards compatibility police. This is more of a cultural issue. A number of the above issues can never really be fixed, since Perl 5 has a very strong commitment to backwards compatibility. So even if something were to be added that effectively replaced the current ball of shit that is tie and overloading, those features will never be removed. Of course, backwards compatibility is also one of Perl 5's greatest strengths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bonus hate</strong>: Perl's built-in exception mechanism is a joke. The fact that exceptions may be a string or object makes for an eternity of fiddly exception-catching code, and the lack of a catch in the language syntax is the wart on the wart.</p></li>

                <p>Scala is my favourite language. Five things to hate? Easy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Takes a long time to learn properly.  I know you can write Scala as a 'better java'.  That is what we used to say about C++ and C too. I agree this is an inevitable consequence of the deep ideas in the language.  But still ...</p></li>
<li><p>Methods vs. Functions: <code>def f(x: Int) = x*x</code> defines a method f, not a function f.  Methods are not functions despite a lot of early Scala tutorial material blurring the distinction.  The language tries to blur it too because if you supply a method in <em>some</em> places where a function is expected it is accepted.  Do we have to have both methods and functions? Yes it is fundamental. But it was initially confusing to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Composing classes or objects from mixins in the 'cake' pattern is prone to NPE's.  e.g. <code>trait X { val host: String; val url = "http://" + host }</code> is a mixin that will NPE on instantiation, or not, depending on its position in the class declaration.  The compiler could tell you if it will fail but doesn't. (In 2.7 anyway.) It is hard to diagnose the problem in complex inheritance graphs.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrays in 2.8 rely on implicits to mesh with the main scala collection types.  But implicits are not applied everywhere. An <code>Array</code> can be supplied where a <code>Seq</code> is expected.  But an <code>Option[Array]</code> cannot be supplied where an <code>Option[Seq]</code> is expected.   I know there are no completely 'right' ways to handle java Arrays. </p></li>
<li><p>Type erasure.  Enough said.</p></li>

                <h2>German</h2>
<p>My native language... Though it can sound even more beautiful than Klingon it's a grammar hell...</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>conjugations</strong>: even regular verbs have different forms for each person and time (with few exceptions)... Example: I see, you see, he/she/it sees, we see, you see, they see translates into: Ich sehe, du siehst, er/sie/es sieht, wir sehen, ihr seht, sie sehen.</li>
<li><strong>polite form of address</strong>: equals 3rd person plural, used to equal 2nd person plural in the middle age... I really hate the concept of distinguishing between "Du" and "Sie" for my philosophy is that each human being should be considered equal in the amount of respect for it deserves (I mean, what are swear words for, hm?)</li>
<li><strong>punctuation</strong>: show me a language that uses more commas regularly!</li>
<li><strong>missing suitable words</strong>: eg. there's no <em>real</em> German equivalent of "convenience" or any derivate of this word... in almost every case you just can't translate it into another German word and keep the meaning... instead you would have to make up a whole subset to describe it somewhat adequate...</li>
<li><strong>Anglicisms and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denglisch" rel="nofollow">
Denglish
</a><sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup></strong>: Sure, the English language has "Kindergarten" or "Poltergeist" and what not but the German language is overflowing with Anglicisms nobody needs...

There are influxes on grammar as well, leading to "Denglish" expressions (see linked article at Wikipedia)
There's more, but I don't want to exaggerate this and those are my personal Top5 of what I hate about the German language...</li>

                <p><strong>Perl 5</strong> In order from most annoying to least.</p>
<p>1.) <em>Backwards compatibility police</em>. Yes backcompat is a strength but Perl 5 takes it too far. Now we don't really even get new features in our language without having to enable them explicitly. I'm much prefer the inverse, if a new feature causes a problem let me disable it or enforce old behavior. e.g. perl 5.10 added <code>say</code> I'd rather have <code>no feature 'say'</code> if I have my own <code>say</code> implemented than have to put <code>use feature 'say';</code> or <code>use 5.010;</code>
 also if 5.8 worked but 5.10 didn't. I'd rather have <code>use 5.008;</code> to restrict my code to only use features available up to and including 5.8 if no <code>use version;</code> was defined then it should be defaulted to whatever version you're running, and a recommended practice of not to restrict it unless you have to.</p>
<p>2.) <em>Excessive Boilerplate</em>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use utf8;
use autodie;
use English '-no_match_vars';
use 5.010;
package Package::Name;

BEGIN {
    Package::Name::VERSION = 0.1;
}

sub somesub {
    my $self = shift;
    my ( $param1, $param2 ) = @_;
}
1;
</code></pre>
<p>now you may start coding. This won't change due to #1. of course there are shortcuts to this stuff like <code>use common::sense;</code>  or <code>use modern::perl;</code> which will shorten the above and you may want some slightly different modules or pragma's. But because of #1 we'll never be able to reduce it to.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
package Package::Name 0.01;

sub somesub ( $param1, $param2 ) {
}
</code></pre>
<p>some modules are helping with this, and there is the new package version in 5.0.12 which allows exactly that syntax though I think it requires <code>use 5.012;</code> first, and <code>Method::Signatures</code> but it'll never be completely resolved, (in language).</p>
<p>3.) <em>Poor variable choices</em></p>
<p>slurp a file</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
open my $fh, "&lt; foo" or die $!;
local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
close $fh;
</code></pre>
<p>wtf is <code>$!</code> and <code>$/</code>? rewrite to be legible.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use English '-no_match_vars';
open my $fh, "&lt; foo" or die $ERRNO;
local $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR; # enable localized slurp mode
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
close $fh;
</code></pre>
<p>and lest not forget that the <code>'-no_match_vars'</code> must be there if you don't want to take a performance hit.</p>
<p>How 'bout no direct way to create an anonymous scalar?</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
my $scalar_ref = \do{ my $anon_scalar };
</code></pre>
<p>couldn't they have come up with something?</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
my $scalar_ref = &lt;&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>oh and how about how perl is thread unfriendly because all the variables (including special ones) are global by default. At least now you can use <code>my $_;</code> to lexical scope that and use <code>local</code> on the others.</p>
<p>4.) <em>really ugly syntax</em></p>
<p>MooseX::Declare is a much nicer syntax. Also I wish for -> to be replaced with . (personal preference doesn't matter much)</p>
<p>5.) <em>Too much TIMTOWTDI</em> or <em>Too many best practices</em> Seems like you have to read 3-5 books just to figure out all of <em>how you should be doing things</em>.</p>
<p>6.) Previous (no longer applies). <em>Un-sane releases</em>. 5.10.0 had features 5.10.1 had features no set time 'till the next release. Now it's yearly feature releases with quarterly updates.</p>
<p>7.) <em>Ivory Tower perspective</em>. community problem, seems to be a large number of devs who want high barriers to entry and thinks it's ok to treat <em>n00bs</em> ( or really anyone who disagrees with them ) disrespectfully.</p>
<p>8.) <em>Insane Version Numbers/Strings</em> Perl has floating point version numbers and they're ugly. Oh and the dev's don't know that not all downstream deals with version comparison the same way. Not really a language problem</p>
<pre><code>0.012 # simple
5.012001 # semantic 
4.101900 # time based + version (for multiple versions in a day)
0.035_002 # prerelease
</code></pre>
<p>all valid versions in perl.. can't we just use like...</p>
<pre><code>0.12 # simple
5.12.1 # semantic
20100713 # time based (just use the date and be careful not to need to release more than 1 a day)
0.35-beta2 # prerelease

              The whole thing with the existence of match variables causing a performance hit always struck me as being an irritating misfeature, especially as it is a problem of Perl&#39;s own making. If only the language compiler could determine that a particular RE match wasn&#39;t captured and use the faster code automatically. (One basis for doing that would be identifying that the match vars are never used before the next RE is matched, which is amenable to compiler-level theorem proving.) - <b> Donal Fellows</b>

<p>SQL isn't really my favorite language, but it's one of the top three I use everyday.  There are probably more items, but these are the ones at the top of my mind. </p>
<p>I have a whole slew of problems with <code>SQL*PLUS</code>.  I wrote a Perl replacement that does what I'd like from the command line and I use <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/sql.el" rel="nofollow">
<code>
 sql.el
</code>
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup> in <code>Emacs</code> for interactive <code>SQL</code> sessions.  These tools help me work around my <code>SQL*PLUS</code> issues.</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>Speaking of which:</p>
<h2>Perl</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>"Only <code>perl</code> can parse Perl."  (But this is mostly an issue in syntax highlighting, which I don't prefer to use much anymore for any language.)</p></li>
<li><p>I'm sometimes surprised by "the simple (but occasionally surprising) rule...: It looks like a function, therefore it is function, and precedence doesn't matter."  (From <code>perlfunc(1)</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Dereferencing complex data structures can be confusing at times.  I can't decide if this is a true flaw in Perl or just a consequence of having really powerful data structure facilities.  Either way, I can normally get it right by taking a few minutes to think about what I'm doing.</p></li>
<li><p>No option to cause system calls to raise their errors like the DBI module.  (Thanks to brian d foy, I now know the <code>autodie</code> module on CPAN does this, but I'd like it built-in.)</p></li>
<li><p>Warnings and strictures not enabled by default in scripts.  (The <code>-e</code> option would turn them off for command line use.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Again, there are bound to be more things, but these are issues I've noticed recently.  I'd add the need for <code>=over</code> and <code>=back</code> and the quirky <code>L&lt;...&gt;</code> syntax in <code>POD</code>, but maybe that ought to be a separate list.</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>Now for the trifecta:</p>
<h2>KornShell</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Sourcing a file with arguments replaces the values of the parent script's arguments.  (Executing <code>. file arg1</code> puts <code>arg1</code> in <code>$1</code>.) </p></li>
<li><p><code>ksh</code> is not an ideal interactive shell and defaults to <code>vi</code> key-bindings, rather than <code>emacs</code>.  (My solution is to use <code>bash</code> for interactive shells.)</p></li>
<li><p>Common utilities (such as <code>grep</code>) are implemented differently across different platforms thereby preventing perfect portability.  Some useful commands need to be installed on some platforms and are part of the OS core on others.</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax for conditionals is overly heavy.  (<code>if [ ... ]; then ... fi</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Although it is Turing Complete, you are eventually going to want to move up to a more expressive language like Perl.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One solution for #4 is to get used to short circuit evaluation:</p>

                <p>First post, so take it easy on me :) ... Awesome community site, btw!</p>
<p>I tried reading all other C# replies just so mine doesn't overlap</p>
<p><strong>C#</strong> ... In no particular order:</p>
<p>1) No fallthrough for cases in switch statements. And if there is no fallthrough ... why does one have to explicitly type break; anyway? It's just retarded and confusing since it implies the ability to not have the break;!!! </p>
<p>2) Can't declare a variable with the same name in a child scope, but you can declare a variable by the same name as a class variable? Either allow both or disallow both. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. </p>
<p>3) No optional/default parameters in functions</p>
<p>4) Exceptions in finally{} should be implicitly caught for every line. Or at least, just the NullReferenceException exception. For instance, after accessing a db, one should always clean up. So, the finally block should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>finally
{
  if(par1 != null)
    par1.Dispose();
  if(comm != null)
    comm.Dispose();
  if(conn != null)
    conn.Dispose();
}
</code></pre>
<p>It would be so much cleaner if it could be written as:</p>
<pre><code>finally
{
    par1.Dispose();
    comm.Dispose();
    conn.Dispose();
}
</code></pre>
<p>But, no ... you have to check if you are accessing a null object, otherwise it may throw a NullReferenceException from the finally block .. and who really needs exceptions in the finally block anyway?</p>
<p>5) Generics: you can specify new() to be able to instantiate your generic objects, but that object needs to have a default constructor. Why can't you specify a signature instead so one doesn't need to create empty constructors if it doesn't already have them and just use the constructors it does have. </p>

                <p>C++:</p>
<h1>1: Header files.</h1>
<p>Linking your code is harder than compiling it. Also, the requirement of templates to have the full source in that translation unit is absurd. It's over in that other file there .. the one you compiled two seconds ago. Go look there. Stupid compiler.</p>
<h1>2: Empty standard libraries.</h1>
<p>I mean, yes, there's std::thread in C++0x, but no std::socket or anything of the sort. The primary reason there's no cross-platform code is because you have to learn a new library for every function that you want to perform on more than one platform. Without OS headers or OS functions provided as standard, C++ is only good for pushing bits around.</p>
<h1>3: No multiple returns or return value overloads</h1>
<p>double x, int y, char z = func(); is just as valid as void func(double x, int y, char z);. Please. The only reason ever given for no return value overloading is because we "might" write ambiguous code. Might! Please, give me grief when I actually write ambiguous code, not before.</p>
<h1>4: No reflection</h1>
<p>It's ok to make reflection compile-time. It really is. Not having any makes writing a lot of libraries difficult, at best, and seriously annoys me. I could abuse the preprocessor but..</p>
<h1>5: Duck typing on templates</h1>
<p>Yaargh. Please, concepts and proper template error messages. It's practically impossible to use a library like Boost, just because if you get it wrong, you're shooting in the dark.</p>

                <p>Erlang is absent from this list.  Among my favorite languages, but a few flaws for sure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Syntax.  This includes the 3 terminating tokens (,;.) and aesthetics, but more generally on how the semantic meaning of the code is expressed in text.  An example is on how all lowercase tokens are atoms, so to refer to a function you can't just name it, you have to <code>fun my_function/1</code>, and <code>?PRECEDE_CONSTANTS_WITH_QUESTION_MARKS</code>.  Coming from Scheme, Haskell, etc. you just wish you could use a name.</p></li>
<li><p>Library support is lame.  This is mostly external libraries, but even the old standard library.  Newer versions of Erlang have sensible POSIX regexes, but the old one had a pretty horrible library for basic string manipulation.  You also never know when you're getting the value, or <code>{ok, Value}</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Related:  non-uniform tools for building and distribution.  Ruby has <code>gem</code> and <code>rake</code>, RSpec.  Perl has CPAN.  I'm unaware of decent equivalents in Erlang.</p></li>
<li><p>The few Erlang specific tools are pretty strange.  Mnesia is a great database, but coming from SQL you have lots of trivialities to learn. Same with the documentation <code>@spec</code>, which has a strange way of describing signatures.</p></li>
<li><p>Often the functional paradigm hurts when you just want that little bit of mutation.  Supposing you want a Hash Table, you can't just hack it as in Scheme, or SML.  <code>ets</code> and <code>dets</code> alleviate some of the pain, but not much.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sixth, bonus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import and export syntax for modules is a pile of fail, not unlike Java's 80+ lines of <code>import</code> statements.</li>
</ul>

I KNOW about interfaces, but this is not the point. For many tasks you don&#39;t only need the interface but also the behaviour to be able to code things in an understandable way. Of course one can use the strategy - pattern (for example) to implement MVC, but the better way would have been to be able to add, say, the full data context handling to a System.Windows.Forms.Form by adding a generic base class - oh, and I use PostSharp.NET. It&#39;s amazing.

I totally agree. It&#39;s not understandable to me why they didn&#39;t expand attributes to interception. That would perfectly solve it. - <b> stormianrootsolver</b>

              If you ask me, the compiler should fail with an error if one tries to inherit from two classes with colliding member names. I do, however, believe that this should rarely by the case, given well educated developers who know how to separate concerns and observe the law of demeter.

People who only write code to earn a living (Morts, approximately 90% of developers around) will always give us hell, multiple inheritance or not.

I guess the best way to solve that would be to only allow Elvis and Einstein types to work on software. - <b> stormianrootsolver</b>

<li><p>Arrays (of the associative kind, what Perl calls hash) don't have proper value semantics. This makes them awkward to pass to and return from functions. Also, this means that they can't be nested. For this reason dicts (dictionaries) were invented but too late, the nice array access syntax:</p>
<p><code>$array($foo)</code></p>
<p>is now forever taken by stupid arrays for backwards compatibility. We're now stuck with:</p>
<p><code>dict get $dict $foo</code></p>
<p>which is much more verbose and to me feels less readable.</p></li>
<li><p>No real closures. Though it can be emulated somewhat by globals or namespaces but that defeats the reason for closures in the first place. Although, I can't really see for now how closures can be implemented in a pure value semantics system.</p></li>

                <p><strong>Perl</strong></p>
<p>I love this language, and I don't want to add things that have already been used, but no one has mentioned this yet, so I'll throw it on the pot. When I used this feature, I found it to be the most horrible experience of my life (and I've worked in assembly language):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>write()</code> and <code>format()</code> functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>They have the single worst, ugliest, most horrifying syntax imaginable, and yet they don't manage to give you <em>any</em> more functionality than you could already achieve with some (infinitely prettier) <code>printf()</code> work. <em>No one</em> should <em>ever</em> try to use those two functions to do any output, simply because of how bad they are.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone will disagree, but when I looked into them, hoping they would solve my problem, I found them to be a "world of pain" (to quote the Big Lebowski), and hope that Perl6 has either done away with them or, better, completely rewritten them to be somewhat more usable and useful.</p>

              I used them quite a bit when I first learned Perl for automating reports.  The brilliant thing about format/write is that you can see what the report will look like (more or less) from the format string.  But the mechanism is unwieldy to say the least.

                <p>Python:</p>
<p>I am still a moderate user for python, so my complaints might just well be lock of knowledge or mis-usage. Comments are welcome. I do love this language.</p>
<ol>
<li>Poor thread support and GIL. If you'd like to take use of multicore platform, most of the python programmers would probably recommend multiprocessing or some sort, don't use threading. It wouldn't give you the performance you are expecting.</li>
<li>property only for instance variable. _class_var = property(classmethod(some_method)) just wouldn't work. How can I get a property wrapped class variable?</li>
<li>no access control. All access controls are syntax mangling. Like private is __private, protect is _protected, etc... And hope that everyone programs python follows the naming convention. Come on, we can do better than that.</li>
<li>I agree the python philosophy of being simple and clear syntax but some simple and clear syntax not being supported seems lock of good judgement, in my opinion. Such as, a++, ++a, a-- and --a, self-de/increment, what's wrong with those? foo = (a > b ? a : b) unary operation, what's wrong with those? (I know py2.6 has something similar introduced, but given the massive support of almost every other language for those simple syntax, why reinventing the wheel? why not just follow the best practice? Shouldn't a good thing just keep in its good "form"?)</li>
<li>Program to interface. Python has no interface or abstract class concept (py3k has something called abc), everything is concrete. Providing an "interface" or "abstract" keyword to build class skeleton and guard class inheritance and extension wouldn't be a bad idea I think. It helps on top-down design. Currently, I just have to fill the each of methods with NotImplementedError, quite a tedious job.</li>
<li>I have to add this. version less than 3.x has str and unicode types. This is a true nightmare. It makes ascii and non-ascii/unicode mixing most likely to fail (bad, bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>I saw people complains about speed. I don't get that. Its an interpret language, code not compile to machine code until runtime, that's just the nature of it. You can't compare speed from an interpret language to a compiled one. As far as I can see, among the interpret/scripting languages, python isn't slow.</p>

              agreed. that&#39;s why I said its a nightmare because you can&#39;t 100% sure when you are dealing with pure ascii and when you are dealing with unicode. Luckly is that py3k treats them all unicodes with utf-8 encoding as default (instead of ascii). And that, we are all talking about just unicodes...
++/-- do not seem to be very evil to me.. :) short than i += 1. the thing is i += 1 is a statement which can&#39;t be used in expression, where ++/-- is expression. - <b> jimx</b>

--That probably looks better when surrounded by parenthesis. I like that syntax because you can read it as &quot;foo equals a if a is greater than b, else b&quot;, foo = (a &gt; b ? a : b) is harder to decipher. - <b> Wallacoloo</b>

              The problem is that ++ and -- can be used in expressions like <code>a=b*++a+c[a++]</code>, which IMO is hard to predict the resulting value of a. I have no problem with just <code>a++</code> (even though you&#39;re only saving 1 character). But if it was chosen to allow the later and not the former, it could be more confusing to programmers with background knowledge of a language that has full support for pre/post increment. - <b> Wallacoloo</b>

• Irregular verbs. Yes, I know English and Spanish mentioned them, too, but Quenya was <em>invented</em>. Why does there still need to be irregular verbs?<br />
• No Unicode support. I have to have three different Tengwar fonts on my computer before I can read most messages, and several of them are poorly kerned. This wouldn't really be a huge issue given the existence of a Romanized transcription, but Tengwar is so beautiful, you don't not want to use it.<br />

<ul>
<li>Reference types are nullable by default; in-language null keyword is untyped.</li>
<li>Lack of discriminated unions</li>
<li>Exceptions as <em>default</em>, non-exceptional error handling method - there's not much of an alternative.</li>
<li>archaic switch statement syntax and limitations</li>
<li>Needless distinction between constructors + static methods</li>
<li>Static methods can't be part of an interface</li>
<li>Lack of by-shape interface implementation rather than explicit interface implementation - leading to numerous language design hacks such as the linq query syntax, foreach, collection &amp; object initializers -- none of which can be flexibly reused.  For example, the object initializer syntax may be nice, but plays poorly with immutable objects.</li>
<li>Cannot inherit "interface" of a class independently of implementation - leading to code duplications and overarchitected code that provides interfaces, abstract base classes, a few common implementations, and no way to pick and choose the bits of each to use.  Also; leads to too many code that's tightly coupled to a particular implementation since it's common to explicitly refer to the implementation type rather than an interface.</li>
<li>Cannot multiply inherit via composition since a classes "interface" is tightly coupled to it's implementation; effectively lack of mixins.</li>
<li>The above limitations of interfaces lead to a proliferation of virtually identical interfaces that don't overlap naturally in any kind of type hierarchy.  <code>IComparable</code> vs. <code>IEquatable</code> vs. <code>IComparable&lt;T&gt;</code> vs object.Equals vs. operator == etc. etc.  By extension, making a custom type that satisfies all these things is a lot more work than necessary (in particular for collection classes).  Obviously, the language designers realize this, hence the various workarounds for things like linq, foreach and collection initializers which work by-shape rather than by-interface.</li>
<li>Redundant use of parentheses and braces rather than layout-is-structure.</li>
<li>Return values can be ignored, limiting the effectiveness of type inference.</li>
<li>Enums aren't a normal type and can't have methods.  Also, enum values aren't typesafe and may be initialized to 0 despite not having a 0 value.  Mixing metaphors by lumping flag and non-flag enums together.</li>
<li>Lack of proper value type support.  Value types can't be inherited, have different constructor semantics, and perform poorly due to CLR limitations.  Also, confusing semantics regarding value types: some values are really values (and can't be modified), and others are really non-aliased, non-null references (variables).  This gets particularly confusing with regards to the next issue:</li>
<li>Semantic distinction between fields and properties, particularly in conjunction with lack of mutability modifier (ala C++'s <code>const</code>)</li>
<li>Can't specialize generics</li>
<li>Cannot provide default generic type parameters (e.g. factory generics)</li>
<li>lack of typedef makes generics a pain to use (<code>using</code> is a limited but good-to-know substitute!)</li>
<li>Can't genericize over things other than types (e.g. functions, plain values, or names).  This means you can't do something like make a generic implementation of a dependancy property leading to, well, nasty implementations of things like dependancy properties and the overuse of code-snippets and poorly readable code as a result.</li>
<li>Limited capability to specify generic type requirements e.g. generic sum method that takes both int, double and a bigint (without tricky and often slow hacks).</li>
<li>An interface method implementation or virtual method override cannot return a more specific type or accept a more general type; i.e. limited co/contravariance support even in C# 4.</li>

I would like to be able to write a series of concatenations of variables and constant string literals, and have the compiler figure out which literals to combine at compile time  and which ones to then automatically add the stringbuffer stuff for.

              You should probably use StringBuilder rather than StringBuffer, if you don&#39;t have multiple threads accessing it. It&#39;s faster.

              I really don&#39;t like this kind of micro optimization. Most of the time, the compiler is clever enough to use StringBuilder, and when it&#39;s not I usually don&#39;t mind the extra microsecond anyway. I prefer readability, and optimize when there is need for it. - <b> rlovtang</b>

<ol>
<li>the dynamic binding of "this" is very confusing and dangerous if you don't know exactly what you're doing. </li>
<li>a function declaration requires the keyword "function". It's not the typing I object to, it's the reading it when I want to do something slightly clever. Hrm now I think of it maybe that's a plus. Discourages me from doing clever things.</li>
<li>As a result of number 2, it's often less code (in terms of characters) to just copy/paste a code segment than to declare it as a function, if it's a fairly short idiom. This unfortunately promotes bad practice, especially in my own code. </li>
<li>Javascript makes motions at being a functional language by having first class functions and closures, but there's no way to verify referential transparency in a function, at either runtime or compile time. Without this, some architectures become either risky or bulky.</li>
<li>Its fantastically bad reputation, and thus my inability to say "I program in javascript" to anyone without being laughed at.</li>

<ol>
<li><p>Sometimes the type system feels backwards. What if I don't want the compiler to infer types for my variables? What if I want the opposite, where it does constraint checking on said variables? For example, instead of inferring the type of the elements of a list, it instead makes sure that they all belong to a particular typeclass. This is a subtle but huge difference that makes it difficult for me to program UIs. It can be done, but it takes more effort than it does in some other languages. Haskell rocks for the non-UI parts, but the UI I leave to an untyped language.</p></li>
<li><p>Allowing the construction of infinite values leads to some really frustrating errors sometimes.</p></li>
<li><p>NoMonomorphismRestriction.</p></li>
<li><p>Bytestring handling bites me in the ass sometimes and you don't know it until your program crashes because you mixed them up improperly. Something is wrong here, when we are losing type information that should have prevented this.</p></li>
<li><p>Typeclasses should be automatically derived for trivial cases, like witness types, but there's a strong potential for abuse there.</p></li>

<p>I know its stupid, but I'd like datatypes to convert to what I want on their own, without me having to add <code>(int)</code> or <code>Convert.ToInt32</code> or whatever. It would just save me time. And it annoys me that if I write something to output an <code>int</code> and then it turns out that I need a <code>long</code>, then often I have to go through and change everything I've done to make it work.

              I agree (and I&#39;m coding in VB.NET). If you look around forums and boards you find a lot of code written in VB.NET which looks like VB6 or even VBScript...the people just think &quot;It&#39;s the same as always&quot; and just refuse to learn anything about the framework or the new features. It goes even so far that someone told me that OOP is &quot;hard to write, read and understand&quot; and VB6 would be way easier.

              I don&#39;t see the need to defend #1. == is a superflous operator, as it does type coercion and is almost never what you want. I do think that while it&#39;s correct, having an impossible value (NaN, null, undefined) not equal another is not pragmatic. I agree that god intended numbers to be floats, but checking bounds on float math (j&lt;i+theta &amp;&amp; j&gt;i-theta) to make sure that we have acceptable values for operations gets real old real fast. And the last one was a joke, but I do find it confusing (and awesome). These are all letters of love to a language I would code in almost exclusively if I could. - <b> thejefflarson</b>

<li>Strange scoping rules - variables, constants, and methods each behave differently from each other. The rules change also depending on which keyword you used to create a closure. Or on whether you're in a class, eigenclass, object, module, or module's self. Then there's instance_eval, which changes the rules to a different set of rules. And they change again when a module is "included" or "extended", which themselves do different things to scope. And some sets of rules can't be emulated by metaprogramming, so you have to use eval. Unless you're on ruby 1.9, where all of this is different.</li>
<li>Namespacing is basically useless. If you have Foo::File, then the stdlib File is probably broken for all of Foo.</li>
<li>require statement is broken. If two files require eachother, the behavior of those files can change dramatically depending on which is loaded first from elsewhere.</li>
<li>libraries change APIs dramatically and suddenly, so you have to require specific minor revision numbers of all of your dependencies. For every single ruby application on your system.</li>
<li>The rubygems package system overrides "require" rather than putting files in the search path - because why use a system when you can replace it?</li>

<li><strong>Script sourcing paths aren't recursive:</strong> Meaning every directory you want to store scripts in must all be added to the script path.</li>
<li><strong>No namespaces:</strong> Forcing the inconsistent use of naming conventions to make sure global procedures don't collide.</li>

<p>Given a list <code>l = [l1, l2, ..., ln]</code>, then <code>repr(l) = [repr(l1), repr(l2), ..., repr(ln)]</code>, but <code>str(l) != [str(l1), str(l2), ..., str(ln)] (str(l) = repr(l))</code>. This was decided because there <em>could</em> be obscure entries in the list like <code>l = ["foo], [bar,", "],["]</code> and <code>str(l)</code> would return <code>"[foo], [bar, ], []"</code> which "could confuse users".

              @Marty: It is a standard practice to left out end element when defining a range, e.g. in C++: <code>iterator.end()</code> is pointer <i>after</i> the last element; in C: <code>for (int *p = a; p != &amp;a[n]; ++p)</code> here&#39;s <code>&amp;a[n]</code> points to next to the last array element.

              If it was inclusive, it&#39;d prevent many good python idioms. First off, s[0:len(s)] would actually give <i>more</i> elements than exist (Though most builtin types will actually treat it like s[0:len(s)-1]). Also, how do you select 0 items? maybe s[2:1]? What about s[0:-1]? Currently, it will not return 0 items, but instead return all but the last element. And yes, I do often take slices of length 0 from arrays (when the indices are calculated from variables) - <b> Wallacoloo</b>

              Well, .NET everything is an object, including the primitive datatypes (the only difference is that they are allocated in the stack).

              Autoboxing sucks. Make everything an object. Allow access to primitives in rare cases. The problem is objects can&#39;t override many operators like - and * etc. So can&#39;t make it work on Integer objects.

<li><p><code>switch</code> is too verbose. Whenever I see a situation where a switch would be proper, I'm really inclined to use an <code>if..else if..</code> just because it's more terse (~30% less typing).

              First you have to write one and write all redundant assignment statements in it. On the other hand, mutable classes support inline initialization syntax by assigning properties just after constructor directive, much easier. Second, with parameterized constructors it&#39;s hard to know what you assign to what. Inline initialization shows you that. .NET 4.0 cures this partially with named parameters. In many functional languages, constructors of immutable classes actually act like &quot;member definitions&quot; at the same time, saving you <i>a lot</i>. See F# or Scala. - <b> ssg</b>

                <p><strong>C#</strong></p>
<p>The number one all time pet hate of C# has to be:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Events have strong references to all listeners thus preventing garbage collection of anything that listens to an event. If you want to see the problems this has caused just search on the net for all the people who have tried to solve the problem by creating some sort of "weak referenced event handler".</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Needing to check if an event equals null before you call it seems like something that should be handled by the language.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> The XML serializer has no way of reading/writing comments in an XML file. Not great in an environment where XML files are modified both by hand and by the tool written in C#. Can be worked around by just using a raw XmlDocument, but would be nicer to be able to abstract that away to a class.</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> The build process doesn't let you directly access things like xsd files, instead you need an intermediate step where you create a C# partial class. This also causes issues with XAML files where you need to rebuild twice sometimes to get changes to flow through properly.</p>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> No support for CPU intrinsics like MMX and SSE 1,2,3,4 and thus these valuable CPU features go unutilised when running C# apps.</p>
<p>Others that didn't make my top 5:</p>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> Can't tag fields as properties, all properties have to be explicitly implemented from the get go:</p>
<p>E.g. currently has:</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private int someInt;

    public int SomeInt {
        get {
                return someInt;
        }
        set {
                someInt = value;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Would like</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    [IsProperty(public, get, set)]
    private int someInt;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>(7)</strong> No support for multiple return values e.g:</p>
<pre><code>public int, string, double MyFunction()
{
    ....
    return x,y,z;
}


public void TestMyFunction()
{
    int x, string y, double z = MyFunction();
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>(8)</strong> No support for covariant return types</p>
<p>I have some gripes about the generics implementation, but I'll cut it there. I think C# is a great language for doing all the GUI, networking and configuration plumbing and is my number one language for getting things up and going quickly in a way that can be supported in the long run.</p>

                <p>C#</p>
<p>1) Lack of practical ability to write generics for value types.  For example, any idiot (well most idiots) can write a routine that calculates the standard deviation of a list of int, float, double, etc in C++, it is straightforward to write, easy to read and performs as fast non-generic code.  I think if you can write something in C# that is close to hitting any one of these 3 without being ridiculous on the other 2, you are a really great programmer.</p>
<p>2) Covariance and contra variance, although this is being added to 4.</p>
<p>3) Extremely poor documentation of LINQ (alright, not really part of the language).</p>
<p>4) Trying to use foreach/iterators when I want to do the same thing every time except something slightly different the last time (such as concatate a bunch of strings with commas between them and the word and between the last two).  If I write it with an IEnumerable, it is hard to write and read, and with a for (int i=0 i &lt; ...) it isn't much better and it is less efficient.</p>
<p>5) I know I am going to get complaints about this, but lack of checked exceptions.  This does not need to be implemented the way it is in java (The framework developers do make some very good points on why they didn't do this), but I would be happy with a compiler warning users who don't like checked exceptions can turn off.</p>

              If you want to concatenate strings with commas do it differently in the first iteration (you prepend the strings in all but the first iteration with a comma).

                <p>Python:</p>
<p>1) It's a scripting language and not a fully compiled one (I'd prefer to be able to compile binaries—I don't care about bytecode). This is very annoying if I have to use very many libraries (i.e. everyone who uses my program has to install all the libraries, and this basically means no normal people will be able to, or have the patience to, properly set it up—unless I do a ton of work that should be unnecessary). I know ways to make binaries, but they don't <em>always</em> work, and I'm guessing they bundle the interpreter in the binaries anyhow (and I don't want that). Now, if I could get a bytecode compiler that would include copies of all the files that I imported (and only those) to be placed in my program's folder, that might be a suitable compromise (then no one would have to download extra libraries and such). It would also be nice if the compiled python files could be compressed into a single file with one specified as the file to run the program before this is done.</p>
<p>2) It seems a bit buggy at times; there have been a few times when code that was supposed to work simply did not (there were no programmer errors), particularly code relating to such as "from moduleX import *", and other import-related issues, as well as some issues pertaining to global and local variables.</p>
<p>3) Maximum recursion depth could be higher. There has been at least one time when I felt that I needed it to go higher.</p>
<p>4) No switch statement (let alone one that allows for numbers, strings and ranges)</p>
<p>5) The newer Python versions seem to be doing away with a lot of useful string operations, and they don't seem to have simple documentation on how to do the same things without them.</p>
<p>6) Forced automatic garbage collection (I'd like to be <em>able</em> to do it manually, although not necessarily forced to do so).</p>
<p>7) No pre-made Timer class without the use of a GUI (well, there might be one, but after all the searching I've done, it's sure not convenient to find! I actually did find something, but it didn't work at all when I tried it.) By a timer, I mean the sort that will execute a specified function every x seconds, with the ability to turn it off when desired, etc.</p>
<p>8) People in the community who give examples rarely tell what modules they imported, and how they imported them.</p>
<p>9) There's not a lot of support for integration with Lua.</p>
<p>10) There doesn't seem to be a way to add an extra function to a particular instance of a class (and not the entire class at large), unless you dynamically add an object variable to that class with the object having the needed function (but still, you have to make another class just for that).</p>

              re 1: the problem with that is that you have one data structure for everything (including classes) and a class is just a special table. Thus, you&#39;re just calling a function in a table to lua. Though having the environment set itself to whatever you&#39;re in (instead of a global scope) on function call would be nice. - <b> RCIX</b>

              I see. On point 1, I didn&#39;t mean that the &quot;not self&quot; behaviour should be eliminated from the language - I said it should be switched; so foo.bar(1,2) passes &quot;self&quot; and foo:bar(1,2) doesn&#39;t pass self.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The built-in error system is absolutely horrendous</strong></p>
<p>You can implement a try-catch system by modifying the Lua interpreter; but it has no compatibility with the errors that are thrown by the built in functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The fact they have __newindex instead of __setindex as the setter</strong></p>
<p>... and __newindex is only fired when the key doesn't already exist.  If it does, no metamethod is called at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No good type comparison system.</strong></p>
<p>There's the type() function but it only handles the basic types (all tables are tables).  It really needs to have a metamethod for type comparisons.  I've implemented this before with an 'is' operator and a __type metamethod and it works really nicely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's a bitch to define new keywords.</strong></p>
<p>You can do it, but the code inside Lua isn't well documented so it's kind of trial and error to find out how to get the result you want.  This is a major issue when you want to implement the things I mentioned above yourself (not so much __setindex though, that's an easy modification).</p></li>

              The goto thing got me amazed. Can you explain why not having it is a bad thing? - <b> egarcia</b>

              <code>goto</code> is sometimes useful. Many people don&#39;t know how to use it, use it in a bad manner, abuse it, or blindly teach other people that <code>goto</code> is the Dark Lord Satan. It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s just a tool, which you have to know to use properly, that&#39;s all. Anti-goto crusaders are just retarded people that don&#39;t know how to do something hence want nobody to be able to do it. - <b> Lo'oris</b>

              The goto operator is available as of PHP 5.3.

              What&#39;s wrong with the references. You put an &quot;&amp;&quot; in there and it&#39;s a reference. Without it, it&#39;s not. Where&#39;s the problem? - <b> Techpriester</b>
